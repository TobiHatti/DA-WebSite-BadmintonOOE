Die Auslosungen für die Mannschaftsmeisterschaften, </strong><br><strong>von der Bundesliga bis zur 2.Klasse, stehen fest und sind auf </strong><br><strong>der Tournament-Software eingearbeitet. Der Terminplan für die österr.-</strong><br><strong> und oberösterreichischen Turniere ist ebenfalls veröffentlicht.</strong></p><p>Termingerecht haben fast alle Vereine die Ranglisten für die einzelnen <br>Mannschaften abgegeben. Die administrative Vorbereitung auf die <br>kommende Saison wurde, wie in den letzten Jahren, von unserer Schriftführerin Karin Burger tadellos erledigt. Auch die <br>Melde-Disziplin der Vereine hat sich wieder deutlich verbessert. Der im Mai neugewählte Verbandsvorstand hat seine erste<br>Bewährungsprobe hinter sich. Ich möchte mich bei allen Beteiligten für den Einsatz herzlich bedanken.</p><p>In einigen Wochen geht es dann so richtig los. Am 12. September startet die O.Ö. Mannschaftsmeisterschaft. Bereits<br> am 8. und 9. September finden die Bundesmeisterschaften der Dachverbände statt. Unser Bundesland ist in den beiden <br>Bundesligen, die am 6.10.2018 starten, heuer mit 4 von 12 Mannschaften vertreten. Spannende Auseinandersetzungen <br>sind dabei in beiden Ligen zu erwarten. Die zahlreichen Lokalderbys haben dabei einen besonderen Reiz. Wir können <br>gespannt sein, wie sich die Meisterschaften in den div. O.Ö. Ligen entwickeln. Vielleicht gelingt es einer Mannschaft <br>den Aufstieg in die Bundesliga zu schaffen.</p><p>Ein Teil unserer BORG-Sportler ist gerade dabei, sich gemeinsam mit den Tischtennis – SportlerInnen des O.Ö. Kaders <br>auf einem Trainingslager in China, in Begleitung des Landestrainers Peter Zauner, auf die Saison vorzubereiten. <br>Bereits im August wurde in der Landessportschule in Linz ein Trainingskurs für den Nachwuchs und teilweise der <br>allgemeinen Klasse abgehalten. Die neu gestaltete Landessportschule hat dabei eine besondere Motivation bei <br>den Beteiligten ausgelöst.</p><p>Der in der letzten Saison gegründete Nachwuchsarbeitskreis hat ein umfangreiches Trainings- und Turnierprogramm <br>entwickelt. Einige neue Funktionäre haben in der Diskussion um den Nachwuchs neue Ideen eingebracht. <br>Das Gemeinsame wird deutlich mehr in den Vordergrund gestellt.</p><p>Ich bin überzeugt, dass die Basis für eine spannende und interessante Saison geschaffen ist.

Am Anfang der langen Anreise nach China gab es schon Komplikationen wegen eines Koffers, <br>der ohne Besitzer am Flughafen stand. Nach einer kurzen Verzögerung durch die großräumige Absperrung konnten wir uns dann Richtung <br>Gate begeben. Der Flug hob pünktlich ab und die Flugzeit betrug 8h 40 min. Während des Fluges gab es einige kleine Turbulenzen, <br>doch sonst war er sehr angenehm.</p><p>Als wir in China angekommen sind haben wir den Bus genommen Richtung Bahnhof. Wir machten einen kurzen Halt in einem Restaurant <br>und wir nahmen die erste Mahlzeit in China ein. Den Schnellzug nahmen wir um 11:40 und wir fuhren ein bisschen mehr als zwei Stunden.<br>Am Bahnhof in Jinan wurden wir von den Trainern abgeholt und fuhren dann mit dem Bus ins Hotel. Den Rest des Tages haben wir uns ausgeruht, <br>am Abend besichtigten wir dann die Trainingshalle.</p><p>Beim Frühstück gab es traditionelles chinesisches Frühstück. Am Anfang mussten wir uns daran gewöhnen doch inzwischen finden es alles lecker.</p><p>Das Training fing am nächsten Tag um 8:00 Uhr in der Früh an. Das Mittagessen war, wie an jedem Tag, um 12.00 Uhr. Nachdem hatten wir eine <br>Mittagspause, wo wir uns meisten ausgeruht haben und wenn wir nicht gerade eine Pause gemacht haben, gingen wir meistens in die Stadt.</p><p>Im Nachmittagstraining hatten wir bis jetzt zumeist eine Fitnesseinheit.</p><p>Bis jetzt kann man sagen, dass das Trainingslager sehr gelungen ist und natürlich auch überaus anstrengend.</p><p><strong>Programm der ersten Tage:</strong></p><p><strong>Montag:</strong><br>8:15-11:30<br>30 min aufwärmen<br>60min: Krafttraining: 4 Stationen 2er Teams, Kniebeugen, Ausfallschritt, Bizeps, Handgelenk, Bank drücken-am Ende 100 schnelle kurze Wh.<br>30 min.

Durch gekürzte Sätze, große Disziplin aller Teilnehmer und der sehr guten Turnierleitung war es möglich um 18:30 die Sieger der Bewerbe zu küren. Die Firmen Headstart, Wilson und die ansässige Raiffeisenbank haben es ermöglicht, das alle  Preisträger auch Sachpreise erhielten. Ein kleiner Höhepunkt für unsere jüngsten war sicherlich die Verlosung des neuen Babolat Satelite Synchro Rakets, dass die Fa. Sportkoch zur Verfügung stellte. Der Gewinner des Babolat Schlägers hieß Mittermayr Lukas vom BC Alkoven. Viel Freude mit dem Schläger! Besonders erwähnenswert die Spieler, die mit gleich 3 Goldmedaillen ausgezeichnet werden konnten.<br>Dies waren:<br><strong>Gösweiner Christina</strong> (BC Windischgarsten)<br><strong>Aigner Daniel</strong> (BC Windischgarsten)<br><strong>Andrej Servov</strong> (Askö Traun)</p><p>Medaillenspiegel:</p><table border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Verein</strong></td><td><strong>Gold</strong></td><td style=\"width: 22.4575%;\"><strong>Silber</strong></td><td style=\"width: 12.712%;\"><strong>Bronze</strong></td></tr><tr><td>BC Windischgarsten</td><td>8</td><td style=\"width: 22.4575%;\">5</td><td style=\"width: 12.712%;\">6,5</td></tr><tr><td>ASKÖ Traun</td><td>5,5</td><td style=\"width: 22.4575%;\">2</td><td style=\"width: 12.712%;\">3</td></tr><tr><td>ABV Wels</td><td>2,5</td><td style=\"width: 22.4575%;\">4</td><td style=\"width: 12.712%;\">10,5</td></tr><tr><td>BC Alkoven</td><td>2</td><td style=\"width: 22.4575%;\">3,5</td><td style=\"width: 12.712%;\">3,5</td></tr><tr><td>ASKÖ Linz</td><td>–</td><td style=\"width: 22.4575%;\">3,5</td><td style=\"width: 12.712%;\">6,5</td></tr></tbody></table>","2008-11-30","/content/news/ASKOE-Landesmeisterschaften-2008-in-Windischgarsten/5b96ba2ca4102.png","6");

Dezember fand in Windischgarsten das 2. Oberösterreichische E-RLT statt. Von 21 genannten Sportlern waren schließlich hochmotivierte 19 Spieler von neun verschiedenen Vereinen am Start. Als Sieger ging der für UBC Vorchdorf spielende Bernhard Gruber hervor, der sich in einem über drei Sätze gehenden Finale gegen Christoph Kainrath (BSC 70 Linz) durchsetzten konnte. Interessant dabei: Gruber und Kainrath spielten bereits beim 1. E-RLT der aktuellen Saison in Ohlsdorf ein 3-Satz-Match. Auch damals konnte Bernhard Gruber gewinnen, allerdings fand diese Begegnung bereits in der Vorrunde statt. Im Spiel um Platz 3 konnte sich der für Kremsmünster spielende Paul Zwicklhuber gegen Andi Weilguni (Union Ventigo Windischgarsten) durchsetzten.

Badminton-Bundesliga. Obwohl der Kader verletzungsbedingt nicht vollständig zur Verfügung stand, erkämpfte das Team um Iris Freimüller einen Sieg und ein Unentschieden. Gegen Racketlon Klosterneuburg sah am Samstag alles bereits nach einem Sieg aus, doch letztendlich mussten sich die Alkovener mit einem Remis zufrieden geben. Iris Freimüller gewann ihr Einzel und zusammen mit ihrer aus der Babypause in das Team zurückgekehrten Schwester Tina auch das Doppel. Auch Thomas Hahn spielte stark und gewann das 1. Einzel und das Doppel mit dem erst 15-jährigen Simon Rebhandl. Im entscheidenden Mixed lief bereits alles für die Alkovener Paarung Tina Freimüller /Simon Rebhandl. Der 1.Satz wurde schnell und klar gewonnen, dann aber schlichen sich einige vermeidbare Fehler ein. Die Niederösterreicher wurden immer stärker und konnten die Partie noch knapp im 3. Satz für sich entscheiden. Am Sonntag war WBH Wien zu Gast. In geänderter Formation sah es vorerst nicht recht rosig aus. Leider gingen alle drei Doppelspiele verloren und die Wiener gingen somit 3:0 in Führung.  Dann aber begann eine furiose Aufholjagd der Alkovener. Thomas Hahn, Lukas und Simon Rebhandl und Iris Freimüller gewannen alle Einzelspiele. Damit hing wieder alles am Mixed. Iris Freimüller/Lukas Rebhandl präsentierten sich von Beginn an stark und ließen der Wiener Paarung keine Chance.

Natürlich waren nicht nur die Spielerinnen und Spieler des BLZ Vorchdorf am Start, auch die Schüler des BORG für Leistungssport in Linz konnten Ihre Leistungen zeigen und zum guten Abschneiden des Landesverbandes OÖ beitragen. Klaus Dornig errang mit seinem Partner Christoph Almer im Herren-Doppel U19 eine Bronze-Medaille und Jakob Ostermann und Manuel Dornig im Herrendoppel U17 eine Silbermedaille. Die Österreichischen Meisterschaften U17/19 in Judenburg waren für denTrainingsstützpunkt Vorchdorf erneut ein voller Triumph. Insgesamt acht Medaillen (3 Gold, 1 Silber und 4 Bronze) holten die Athleten nach Oberösterreich. Allein unserem Trainingsstützpunkt ist es zu verdanken, dass der LV Oberösterreich noch den erfreulichen zweiten Platz im Medaillenspiegel erreichen konnte. Florian Baumgartner (Union Ohlsdorf) schaffte mit drei Goldmedaillen in der Altersklasse U17 am Wochenende den Hattrick. Der Ohlsdorfer gewann das Jungeneinzel, mit Partner Thomas Sturm (Union Ohlsdorf) das Doppel und mit Alexandra Mathis das Mixed. Für eine positive Überraschung sorgte Lukas Rebhandl (Ventigo Union Windischgarsten) im Einzel. Der Windischgarstener schlug im Viertelfinale mit dem Wiener Vilson Vattanirappel, den eigentlichen Favoriten im Einzel. Ein erstaunliches Bild gab es am Freitagabend in der toll aufbereiteten Halle. Im Mixed-Halbfinale standen sich ausschließlich auf allen vier Courts BLZ-Vorchdorf-Spieler gegenüber. Der U15-Spieler Simon Rebhandl (Ventigo Union Windischgarsten) zeigte mit einer Silbermedaille im Mixed und einer Bronze-Medaille im Doppel mit seinem Bruder Lukas erneut sein Talent. In der U19 sind wir mit keinen Medaillenanwärtern an den Start gegangen. Somit waren unsere Erwartungen im Vorfeld bereits gedämpft. Unsere einzigen Starter Thomas Wimmer (Union Ohlsdorf) und Günter Kofler (UBC Vorchdorf) mussten sich in den ersten Runden, technisch und taktisch besseren Spielern, klar geschlagen geben. Als Erkenntnis von Judenburg bleibt, dass wir die Altersklasse U17 im Jungenbereich (noch) dominieren. Wollen wir das auch in höheren Altersklassen fortführen, muss der Trainingsumfang weiter gesteigert werden. Andere Landesverbände holen immer weiter auf.<br>Alle Ergebnisse unter <a href=\"http://www.badminton.at\">www.badminton.at</a><br>Manuel Rösler, Sportlicher Leiter Trainingsstützpunkt BLZ Vorchdorf</p>","2009-02-09","/content/news/Florian-Baumgartner-ist-3facher-OEsterreichischer-Meister/5b96c1546c994.png","7");

Mit Finalteilnahmen in allen 5 Bewerben und dem Sieg in 3 Bewerben erfüllten die Vertreter des OÖ Leistungsbadminton alle Ansprüche bei weitem. Mit etwas Glück wäre speziell im DD und HD noch die eine oder andere Medaille drinnen gewesen. In der Königsdisziplin, den Einzelbewerben, stellte im HE OÖ mit Lahnsteiner Michael und Zauner Peter ( beide Askö Traun) sogar beide Finalisten. Wobei der Umstand, dass 3 von 4 Semifinalisten aus dem Sport Borg in Linz kamen, die Qualität dieser Einrichtung eindrucksvoll bestätigt. Im Finale konnte sich Zauner Peter doch überraschend sicher gegen Michael Lahnsteiner durchsetzen und sich so zum 2. Mal nach 2006 den Einzelstaatsmeistertitel sichern. Im DE Finale spielte sich Miriam Gruber (Vorchdorf) ungefährdet ins Finale. Mit Mayer Claudia hatte sie es dort mit einer ebenbürtigen Gegnerin zu tun. Leider schlichen sich des Öfteren leichte Fehler speziell im Netzbereich ein und dadurch musste sich Miriam mit dem 2. Platz zufriedengeben. Noch mehr Pech hatte Freimüller Iris (BC Alkoven), die als Favorit im DD mit Partnerin Riedl Tina ebenfalls sicher ins Finale kam. Eine Verletzung von Tina im Semifinale des DD verhinderte ein Antreten im Finale, und so musste der Sieg der Paarung Heber/Baldauf kampflos überlassen werden. Eine Klase für sich war die Paarung Jürgen Koch/Peter Zauner im HD Bewerb. Erst im Finale konnten sie etwas gefordert werden, wobei der Sieg nie gefährdet war. Mit hohem Tempo und sehr variablen Spiel auch in Drucksituationen, kamen ihre Gegner mit ihrem Angriff selten zu einem Punktgewinn. In sehr überzeugender Manier ging dieser Staatsmeistertitel ebenfalls nach OÖ. Überraschend war das Erreichen des Finales im Mixed Doppel von Jürgen Koch/Zhou Niannian. Überraschend deshalb da Zhou meist nur einmal die Woche trainieren kann. Eng war es bis zur Mitte des ersten Satzes, danach konnte das Spiel aber immer mit 3 bis 4 Punkten Vorsprung kontrolliert werden. Mit diesem Titelgewinn gingen 3 von 5 Staatsmeistertiteln nach OÖ.</p><p><strong>Ergebnisse aus OÖ Sicht:</strong></p><p>HE<br>1. Zauner Peter<br>2. Lahnsteiner Michael</p><p>DE<br>2.

März war das Motto  „just for fun“ angesagt, und dieses nahmen sich einige zu Herzen. In der Sporthalle Haid wurde das 3. Oberösterreichische E-Turnier veranstaltet. Das Turnier begann um 9:40 Uhr und endete mit der Siegerehrung und einer  kleinen Tombola um 16:30 Uhr. Von 44 genannten Sportler(Innen) wollten es 11 Damen und 31 Herren von 17 verschiedenen Vereinen wissen wer an diesem Tag die besseren Bälle schlägt.  So einen Tag erwischte Christoph Kainrath (BSC 70 Linz) der spätere Turniersieger kam ohne Satzverlust ins Finale. Doch auch sein Finalgegner Thomas Leierzopf (ASK Nettingsdorf) musste sich in zwei Sätzen geschlagen geben. Im Spiel um Platz drei konnte sich der für Kremsmünster spielende Paul Zwicklhuber gegen Andreas Böhm (BSC 70 Linz) in zwei Sätzen durchsetzen. Einen Damenbewerb in einem E-Turnier gab es schon lange nicht mehr, obwohl es keine Punkte für die österreichische sondern nur für die oberösterreichische Rangliste gibt waren die Damen voll motiviert. Im spannenden Damenfinale konnte Simone Leutgeb (ASK Nettingsdorf) das Match in drei Sätzen gegen Melanie Fröhlich (ASKÖ Linz) für sich entscheiden. Im Spiel um Platz drei konnte Roswitha Ben Ahmed (ASK Nettingsdorf) gegen die für Neuhofen spielende Julia Peter in zwei Sätzen gewinnen.  Ein Dankeschön an alle Teilnehmer(Innen) und vielleicht sieht man sich wieder, am 19.

Mit 23 aktiven Sportlern war das Camp voll ausgebucht. Karina Lengauer und Vladimir Serov bemühten sich um jeden Sportler, und konnten im technisch taktischen Bereich ihr profundes Wissen den jungen Nachwuchsspielern weitergeben. Ein Highlight stellte diesmal auch ein Mental-Kurs dar. Dieser konnte nur durch die Untersützung der ASKÖ OÖ im Rahmen eines Projektes stattfinden. Karin Burger lieferte den jungen Sportlern einen Auszug dessen, was mental möglich ist. In 4 Doppelstunden, die gespickt waren von verschiedensten Übungen und praktischen Beispielen, wurde auch der theoretische Hintergrund dieser Thematik vermittelt. Die Teilnahme an den mentalen Einheiten war freiwillig. Der Umstand das 20 Kinder und Jugendliche den Kurs begonnen haben, und 18 bis zur letzten Einheit durchhielten, zeigt dass wir mit diesem Thema doch das Interesse der Teilnehmer geweckt haben. Die NachwuchsspielerInnen haben in allen Einheit guten Einsatz und Konzentration gezeigt, und konnten so sportlich wie mental einiges dazulernen.

Vor allem unsere Jugendlichen konnten sich gut in Szene setzen. Im Einzel konnte Jakob Ostermann das Finale erreichen. Der junge Spieler aus dem Leistungssport Borg in Linz musste sich nur dem aus Slovenien stammenden Steiermarker Matjaz Adler in 3 Sätzen knapp geschlagen geben und konnte so seinen bis jetzt größten Erfolg einfahren. Auch Thomas Sturm war ausgezeichnet in Form, und belegte den 4. Platz. Florian Baumgartner (5), Lukas Rebhandl (7) und Günter Kofler (9) zeigten mit ihren Platzierungen die Leistungsstärke der Spieler aus Oberösterreich. Eine totale Übermacht stellten die jungen oberösterreichischen Spieler aber im Doppelbewerb dar. Gleich 3 der 4 Semifinalpaarungen kamen aus Oberösterreich. Den Sieg trugen Florian Baumgartner / Thomas Sturm (beide Sportunion Ohlsdorf) vor Bittenauer / Schlemmer (NÖ) davon. Den 3. Platz teilten sich Rebhandl / Rebhandl (beide Union Windischgarsten) mit Ostermann / Dornig (beide BC Windischgarsten).

Jeden Mittwoch von 18.00 bis 20.00 Uhr trainieren talentierte BadmintonspielerInnen aus dem Raum Linz und Umgebung am Olympiastützpunkt auf der Gugl unter der Leitung von Trainer Vladimir Serov. „Vladimir macht einen hervorragenden Job, dessen Arbeit vom Vorjahr bereits erste Früchte trägt, denn beim ersten U11-/U13-RLT stammten bereits 3 von 4 möglichen Siegern vom BTZ Linz“, so der Administrator des BTZ Linz Markus Benda. Heuer wird erstmals großes Augenmerk auf den Schülerbereich (also U11 bis U15) gelegt, wobei man für die Jugendlichen noch eine eigene Trainingsmöglichkeit schaffen möchte. Neben der Verbesserung der Beinarbeit und Schlagtechnik wird man auch im mentalen Bereich einige zusätzliche Einheiten absolvieren. Die ersten beiden Trainings gelten als sogenannte „Sichtungstrainings“, wozu alle Vereine herzlichst eingeladen sind, ihre talentiertesten NachwuchsspielerInnen auf die Gugl zu schicken. Ziel des Badminton Talentezentrums Linz ist es auch, die SpielerInnen durch Vorbereitung und Motivation ins BORG für Leistungssport zu führen.</p>","2009-09-24","/content/news/Start-des-Badminton-Talentezentrums-Linz-in-die-neue-Saison/5b96c39ea1588.png","2");

Glücklos und der eingeräumten Favoritenrolle nicht gerecht geworden agierte der BSC 70 Linz gestern im Auftaktmatch gegen den Titelverteidiger WBH Wien. Da traute das favorisierte Team seinen Augen nicht, als auch das entscheidende Mixed Doppel verloren ging. „Man fährt nicht einfach zum aktuellen Meister und gewinnt ohne sein bestes Badminton gespielt zu haben. Für uns alle war der Druck wahrscheinlich zu groß.“ resümiert Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger nach dem Spiel. Bereits im Vorfeld hat er davor gewarnt, Wien oder jedes andere Team nicht zu unterschätzen. Respekt vor Wien zum gestrigen Spiel. Sie haben sicherlich ihr Optimum herausgeholt. Auch wenn der BSC 70 Linz von vielen Mannschaften als Titelaspirant genannt wurde, haben die Linzer gestern wohl nicht danach ausgesehen. Der Schock steckt tief bilanziert auch Trainerfuchs Tariq Farooq nach dem Spiel. „So etwas habe ich in meiner ganzen Trainerlaufbahn noch nicht gesehen. Das Team war nicht so wie ich es kenne. Der Wille war da, aber wir konnten unsere Stärken nicht nützen.“ Einzige Lichtblicke an diesem Spieltag waren Miha Sepec und Claudia Mayer. Beide gewannen ihre Spiele absolut souverän. Das hätte man sich auch von den anderen erhofft. Am nächsten Spieltag wollen sich die Linzer wieder optimal präsentieren. Noch einen Ausrutscher können und wollen sie sich nicht mehr erlauben. Auch gegen Klagenfurt werden sie wohl wieder als Favoriten gehandelt, sind diesmal aber unter Zugzwang und müssen ihre Favoritenrolle auch beweisen.</p>","2009-09-21","/content/news/Enttaeuschender-Saisonauftakt-fuer-BSC-70-Linz-in-Wien/5b96c42fd078d.png","3");

Vom österreichischen Badmintonverband wurden Florian Baumgartner und Thomas Sturm (beide BLZ Vorchdorf) nominiert. Beide Spieler treten seit Beginn dieser Saison mit anderen Partnern im Doppel an. Florian spielt mit Vilson Vattanirappel (WBH Wien) und Thomas mit Benjamin Schlemmer (Badminton Mödling). Während beim Langenfeld Cup für die Paarung Baumgartner/Vattanirappel noch im Achtelfinale das Turnier beendet war, so konnten sie doch in Belgien das Halbfinale erreichen. Dort unterlagen sie in einem spannenden Spiel der österreichschen Paarung Demmelmayer/Thormann, wie bereits eine Woche zuvor beim ersten A-Ranglistenturnier. Thomas Sturm schied im Einzel, wie der Großteil der österreichischen Starter, bereits in der ersten Runde aus, lediglich Paul Demmelmayer schaffte im Einzel den Sprung ins Viertelfinale. Im Mixed war für Florian Baumgartner mit seiner Partnerin Alexandra Mathis (UBCS Wolfurt) im Achtelfinale Endstation, sie schieden gegen die an Nummer eins gesetzte, deutsche Paarung Hammes/Domke aus.<br>Ein weiterer Spieler des BLZ Vorchdorf war an diesem Wochenende erfolgreich, Günter Kofler erzielte beim Bundesligaspiel des UBC Vorchdorf gegen ASKÖ Kelag Klagenfurt den Ehrenpunkt, er besiegte Michael Trojan in drei Sätzen.

Im U13-Finale der Burschen war es etwas überraschend, dass hier die U11-Finalisten vom Vorjahr gleich wieder ihren Platz im Finale fanden. Der Sieger war erneut Johannes Weigl (ASKÖ Linz – U13). Im U11-Bewerb der Burschen war das Bruderpaar Dominik und Luka Leko (ABV Wels – U11) eine Klasse für sich. Am Ende durfte sich Dominik ohne Satzverlust über seinen ersten Turniertitel freuen.

Vor allem beim sehr deutlichen Erfolg im Herreneinzel gegen David Obernosterer zeigte er mit sehr trickreichem Spiel, dass er ein ehemaliger Weltklassespieler war und wieder am Weg dorthin ist. Nach Abstimmungsproblemen im ersten Satz konnte er auch im 2. Herrendoppel an der Seite von Klaus Dornig ein klaren Sieg einfahren. Weiters in guter Form scheint auch Simone Prutsch zu sein, die ihr Einzel gegen Alexandra Mathis und auch ihr Mixed an der Seite von Jürgen Koch in beeindruckender Manier gewinnen konnte. Den 5. Punkt für die Trauner holten dann standesgemäß Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner mit einem klaren Sieg im 1. Herrendoppel gegen Obernosterer/ Nichterwitz. Teammanager Herbert Koch meinte nach dem Spiel dazu: „Die Aufstellung war auf relativ sichere 5 Punkte ausgelegt, die wir auch ohne große Probleme erreicht haben.  Mit Ardi Putra als Neuzugang ist uns genau die Verstärkung des Teams gelungen, die wir sportlich wie auch gesellschaftlich gesucht haben. Ich denke auch, dass er mit seiner feinen Technik, Spielwitz und Erfahrung für den gesamten Badmintonsport in Österreich eine Bereicherung ist. Er kann dadurch neue Impulse für alle Spieler bringen.“</p>","2009-09-20","/content/news/ASKOE-Traun-startet-erfolgreich-in-die-Bundesligasaison-20092010/5b96c4b16ac58.png","4");

Der oberösterreichische Badmintonverband stellt dabei mit BSC 70 Linz, ASKÖ Traun, UBC Vorchdorf und BC Alkoven die meisten Bundesligavereine. Diese Saison wird kurioser Weise wieder nicht mit 8 Mannschaften für die 1. Bundesliga gespielt. Nach wie vor ist es möglich, wenn eine Mannschaft aus der 1. Liga zurückzieht, dass keine Mannschaft diesen Platz übernehmen muss. Union BSC Dornbirn hat nach vielen Jahren in der Bundesliga für die kommende Saison leider keine „konkurrenzfähige“ Mannschaft stellen können. Wie immer gilt, wie kann man den amtierenden Mannschaftsmeister vom Thron stürzen? Letzte Saison hat sich – WBH Wien – im spannenden Finale gegen Askö Traun durchgesetzt. Sie sind wieder die gejagten.  Alle Mannschaften waren am Transfermarkt tätig.<br><strong>WBH Wien</strong> musste den Abgang von Jan Vondra (letztjährige Nr. 1) kompensieren. Für ihn kommt der junge Tscheche Jakub Bitmann. Bei den Damen mussten sie sich ebenfalls um einen Neuzugang umsehen, da die stärkste Dame der Liga – Maja Tvrdy – wieder zurück zum BSC 70 Linz gewechselt ist.<br><strong>ASKÖ Traun</strong> musste aufgrund des Wechsels von Michael Lahnsteiner in die Schweizer Liga, einen neuen Herren verpflichten. Der Indonesier Ardiansyah Putra wurde als neue Nr. 1 im Einzel verpflichtet – ist aber auch im Doppel sehr stark.<br><strong>ASKÖ kelag Kärnten</strong> wurden 2 Spieler gesperrt, da diese unerlaubterweise beim Europacup der Landessieger für ihr Bulgarisches Team angetreten waren. Die 2 bulgarischen Nationalspieler METODIEV Vladimir (Doppel- und Mixedspezialist) und BANOVA Gabriela (Doppel- und Mixedspezialistin) sind somit nicht mehr spielberechtigt. Für sie wurden Ana Kovac und Krasimir Yankov geholt.<br>Beim <strong>BSC 70 Linz</strong> hofft man in dieser Saison auf den großen Wurf. Nicht zuletzt auch deshalb, weil es die Jubiläumssaison zum 40jährigen Bestehen des eigenständigen Club ist. Der letztjährige Kader wurde um die beste Dame der Liga erweitert. Maja Tvrdy wird wieder für den BSC 70 Linz antreten. Weiters wurde als Ersatz für den immer noch verletzten Luka Kumelj – Iztok Utrosa geholt. Weltklassespieler Luka Petric bleibt trotz toller Angebote weiterhin beim BSC 70 Linz. Er will dem BSC 70 Linz zum Meistertitel helfen.<br>Für eine Überraschung könnten die beiden Teams von <strong>ASV Pressbaum</strong> und <strong>BSC Wolfurt</strong> sorgen. Beide Teams haben bereits in der letzten Saison gezeigt, dass sie auch die TOP-Teams schlagen können. Auch sie möchten sich einen Platz im Play-off der ersten 4 sichern und haben ihren Kader verstärkt. ASV Pressbaum konnte die kroatische Nr. 1 Andrea Zvorc, den tschechischen Doppelmeister Rene Nedela und Luka Wraber aus Österreich verpflichten.<br>Aufsteiger <strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong> wird wohl wenig Chance eingeräumt. Ihre Mannschaft ist gegenüber der Aufsteigermannschaft nicht verändert. Sie bleiben aber für 2 Jahre auf jeden Fall in der 1. Bundesliga da es in dieser Saison durch „nur“ 7 Mannschaften keinen Absteiger gibt.<br>Die Spitzenteams der kommenden Saison werden aus Sicht von Reinhard Hechenberger (Obmann des BSC 70 Linz) ASKÖ Traun und der ASKÖ BSC 70 Linz sein. Titelverteidiger ASKÖ WBH Wien und ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten werden, so denkt er, um die Play-off Plätze der ersten 4 gegen Pressbaum und Wolfurt kämpfen.</p><p><strong>Zu- und Abgänge der Spitzenteams:</strong><br><em>ASKÖ BSC 70 Linz</em><br>Abgang: Pohar Andrej, Pohar Maja<br>Zugang: Iztok Utrosa (Wr.

Oberösterreich war mit gleich 18 Teilnehmern vertreten und konnte letztendlich 8 Titel für die ASKÖ OÖ. erringen. Die Verteilung der Titel und der massenhaft errungenen zweiten und dritten Plätze zeigt, dass Badminton in Oberösterreich in allen Altersstufen von U11 bis SK55+ in ernsthafter Weise betrieben wird. Auch die Verteilung der Titel und Medaillen auf fast allen teilnehmenden Vereinen zeigt von einer sehr guten Breite des Sportes in unserem Bundesland. Einzig und allein bei den jungen Mädchen scheint es etwas schwieriger zu sein, Talente zu finden. Doch waren schon einige junge Neustarter an den Start gegangen, was darauf hoffen lässt, dass dies nur eine temporäre Erscheinung ist. Als ASKÖ Bundesmeister 2009 dürfen sich Tariq Farooq  (SK55+ Einzel), Hechenberger Reinhard (SK 35 Einzel), Dornig Klaus und Tippelt Nicole (U19 Mixed), Tippelt Nicole (DE U19 Einzel), Aigner Daniel und Dornig Manuel (HD U17 Doppel), Serov Alexander und Serov Andrej (U15 Doppel), Serov Alexander (U15 Einzel), Benda Philipp und Kolbeinson Axel (U13 Doppel) nennen. Herzliche Gratulation noch an dieser Stelle! Ich möchte aber auch noch allen Zweit- und Dritt-Platzierten Kindern, Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen zu den tollen Leistungen gratulieren. Auch atmosphärisch war es, bis auf ganz wenige Ausnahmen, ein sehr gutes Wochenende und ein super Start in die neue Saison. Auf diesem Weg noch allen Aktiven eine gute Saison.<br>Euer ASKÖ OÖ.

OÖ. U15- und U19-Ranglistenturnier der Saison 2009/2010 im Bundesschulzentrum Traun am Start. In acht Stunden wurden auf sieben Feldern die Sieger der Klassen U15 HE und DE sowie U19 HE ermittelt. Etwas enttäuschend die Tatsache, dass aufgrund von Absagen kein U19 DE Bewerb zustande kam. Besonders auffällig war, dass am Ende in allen drei Altersklassen jeweils die jüngere Generation die Nase vorne hatte. Im U15 DE konnte sich die an Nr. 5 gesetzte Ohlsdorferin Katharina Hochmeir (U13-Spielerin) gegen Sejla Dzinziz  aus Windischgarsten in 3 Sätzen durchsetzen. Das U15 HE entschied der an Nr. 3 gesetzte Welser Philipp Benda (ebenfalls erst U13-Spieler) gegen Christian Schauer mit 2:0 Sätze klar für sich. Schließlich gewann auch Alexander Serov (U15-Spieler), an Nr. 7 gesetzt, den Bewerb U19 HE gegen den Ohlsdorfer Lukas Fröhlich ebenfalls in 2 Sätze.

Aus oberösterreichischer Sicht gab es durchaus einige sehr zufriedenstellende Ergebnisse. Ein Semifinale im Herren-Doppel und ein Finaleinzug im Mixed-Doppel für Florian Baumgartner waren aus oberösterreichischer Sicht sicherlich die Hightlights des Wochenendes. Wobei er sich mit seiner Partnerin Mathis Alexandra im Finale der Paarung Heber/Demmelmayr ebenfalls aus Österreich nur nach hartem Kampf geschlagen geben musste. Im Einzel konnte Dornig Klaus im 64er-Raster den 9. Platz erreichen. Mit etwas mehr Ruhe im Spiel wäre eine bessere Platzierung möglich gewesen. Aufgrund einer Trainingsabsenz in der letzten Woche bedingt durch die Vormatura und einer kleinen Verletzung ist auch dieses Ergebnis durchaus zufriedenstellend. Dornig Manuel, Ostermann Jakob, Lukas und Simon Rebhandl konnten im Einzelbewerb die erste Runde überstehen. In der 2. Runde waren die Gegner zu stark. Die Jungs belegten so den 32. Platz. Klaus Dornig konnte im Herren-Doppel-Bewerb mit Almer Christoph noch  ins Viertelfinale kommen. Dort unterlagen sie den späteren Finalisten zwar dem Ergebnis nach eindeutig, aber speziell im letzten Abschnitt des Spieles konnten die beiden ausgezeichnet das internationale hohe Tempo voll mitgehen.</p>","2009-10-19","/content/news/Tolle-Platzierungen-beim-Croatian-Junior-International/5b96c67c36abd.png","5");

Allen voran trugen die Brüder Serov wesentlich zur positiven Bilanz aus Oberösterreichischer Sicht des Wochenendes bei. Im Einzel musste sich Serov Alexander erst  Semifinale nach einigen Ungereimtheiten mit dem Spielstand, seinem körperlich einiges stärkeren Kontrahenten in 3 Sätzen geschlagen geben. Im HE U15 belegte Alexander somit  den 3. Platz. Das Mixeddoppel U15 Semifinale mit Saskia Wallner wurde fast im Anschluss an das HE Semifinale gespielt. Das Einzel hatte aber deutliche Spuren hinterlassen. So spielten sie eher Doppeltaktik. Das Spiel wurde zwar verloren, aber dennoch ist auch hier der 3. Platz ein sehr erfreuliches Ergebnis. Noch besser war das Herren Doppel. Hier startete Alexander mit seinem jüngeren Bruder Andrej. Sie spielten sich am Samstag bis ins Finale. Wobei auch hier bereits das Semifinale sehr knapp über 3 Sätze ging. Am Sonntag im Finale spielten sie gegen die österreichische Paarung Schmid Julian und Kaufmann Gabriel. Sie konnten das Spiel offen halten, doch mussten sie sich zum Schluss dem körperlich kräftigeren Gegner beugen. Der 2. Platz stellt ein Highlight aus oberösterreichischer Sicht dar und lässt auch für die Zukunft einiges erwarten. Philipp Benda konnte die Gruppenspiele für sich entscheiden, musste sich im Raster aber dem Deutschen Hannes Gebrich geschlagen geben. Abgesehen von diesen sehr guten Platzierungen konnten auch alle anderen oberösterreichischen Nachwuchsspieler ausgezeichnete Spiele abliefern und vieles an internationaler Spielerfahrung sammeln. Auch wenn es noch nicht für Medaillen reichte, konnten alle internationale Spieler beobachten und speziell bei den größeren sehen, wo es im Leistungssportbereich hingehen soll. Ein Danke an alle Betreuer, die es auf sich nehmen den Nachwuchsspielern einen Einblick in diese Welt zu gewähren.</p>","2009-10-19","/content/news/Super-Ergebnisse-beim-ADRIA-YOUTH-Cup-in-Kroatien-2009/5b96c6a735b14.png","6");

Vor allem die Präsenz vieler dänischer Spieler spricht für die Qualität dieses Turniers. Heuer stellte auch Österreich ein Team in der Altersklasse U19. Obwohl Simon erst 15 Jahre alt ist, wurde er vom Jugendnationaltrainer für dieses Turnier nominiert. Eigentlich war sein Einsatz gemeinsam mit dem gleichaltrigen Matthias Almer (ST) geplant. Matthias verletzte sich allerdings kurz vorher und konnte nicht an den Start gehen. Trotzdem wurde Simon viermal – zweimal im Herrendoppel und zweimal im Mixeddoppel – eingesetzt. Im Mixeddoppel konnte er gemeinsam mit Sonja Langthaler (NÖ) gegen Finnland gewinnen. Beim zweiten Antreten war gegen ein übermächtiges dänisches Mixeddoppel nichts zu holen. Im Herrendoppel spielte Simon einmal mit Bernd Thormann (ST) gegen ein dänisches Doppel.  Trotz ausgezeichnetem Spiel, setzten sich die Dänen doch noch in drei Sätzen durch. Im letzten Spiel gegen Schweden stand Simon gemeinsam mit Paul Demmelmayer (ST) auf der Matte. Mit ihrem Sieg in drei Sätzen sorgten die beiden für den Ehrenpunkt in der Begegnung um Platz fünf.  Der Trainer war mit Simons Leistung sehr zufrieden. Vor allem in Hinblick auf die U17-Europameisterschaft in Medvode (Slowenien) vom 7. bis 15. November 2009 konnte Simon wertvolle Erfahrungen sammeln.</p>","2009-10-18","/content/news/Simon-Rebhandl-erstmals-beim-U19-Teambewerb-fuer-OEsterreich-im-Einsatz/5b96c6e930438.png","6");

Kommentar von den Beiden nach dem Spiel: „Nach einem klaren Sieg im ersten Satz (21:13) und einem guten Beginn in Satz Nr. 2 verloren wir plötzlich die Konzentration und machten unnötige Fehler.

Es sind immer viele Spieler aus Asien hier und das Turnier ist meistens sehr stark besetzt. Die Atmosphäre bei den Dutch Open ist grandios und es sind auch immer viele Zuschauer hier. Im ersten Spiel haben wir gute Chancen zu gewinnen und dann müssen wir uns wieder von Spiel zu Spiel steigern.“</p>","2009-10-14","/content/news/Doppel-Koch--Zauner-im-Viertelfinale-knapp-gescheitert/5b96c7085934b.png","5");

Exakt 706 Spieler aus 38 Nationen kämpften sieben Tage lang im spanischen Punta Umbria um die Welttitel der Badminton Senioren. Nach drei EM-Teilnahmen war für Harald Starl dies die 1. Weltmeisterschaft in der Klasse 45+.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Neuauslosung bescherte Hammerlos</strong><br>Als Starl die Reise nach Spanien antrat, stand mit dem spanischen Lokalmatador Jesus Chincilla der Auftaktgegner für den Vorchdorfer fest. Doch ein Fehler des Weltverbandes verursachte eine Neuauslosung, deren Ergebnis Starl bei der Ankunft in Punta Umbria erfuhr. Zwar konnte sich der UBC-Oldy die Startrunde dank eines Freiloses ersparen – dafür kam es dann knüppeldick: Zweitrundengegner Oleg Okunev, an Nr. 6 gesetzt, konnte bereits 2003 in der Klasse 40+ den WM-Titel in Sofia gewinnen. Zu Beginn des Matches zeigte Starl wenig Respekt vor dem übermächtigen Gegner und hielt bis zur Mitte des 1. Satzes das Spiel offen. Doch dann kam die russische „Kampfmaschine“ so richtig ins Laufen und Starl unterlag mit 10:21, 14:21. „Es war sicherlich eines meiner besten Badmintonspiele – doch ich war chancenlos,“ so Starl nach Spielschluss.<br><strong>Deutsches Doppel zu stark</strong><br>Nicht viel besser lief es im Herren Doppel, wo Starl mit Tariq Farooq gegen die Deutschen EM-Bronzemedaillengewinner Michael Bunn / Thoams Schneider eine ordentliche „Klatsche“ mit 5:21, 9:21 einstecken mussten. „Da war mehr als eine Klasse Unterschied.“<br>Obwohl Harald Starl bei seiner ersten WM-Teilnahme ohne Sieg blieb, kehrte der Vorchdorfer mit vielen positiven Erlebnissen in seine Heimatgemeinde zurück. „Beeindruckend waren die Finalspiele – besonders die in den Altersklassen ab 60 Jahren und älter. Was da noch für Leistungen geboten werden, ist gewaltig,“ schwärmte Harald Starl. Und sogleich werden neue Ziele festgelegt: Im nächsten Jahr findet die Europameisterschaft in Irland statt, ehe 2011 in Vancouver die 5. Weltmeisterschaften stattfinden.</p>","2009-10-05","/content/news/Russischer-Ex-Weltmeister-war-zu-stark-fuer-Harald-Starl/5b96c766ef072.png","6");

Die Teilnehmer wurden in drei Tagen in einer recht anspruchsvollen aber sehr lehrreichen Art und Weise auf Technik, Taktik und Kondition überprüft, wobei auch die Heimtrainer viele Tips für zu Hause mitnehmen konnten. Erfreulicherweise schafften mit Elena Labmayr (BC Alkoven), Katharina Hochmeir, Jana Haas und Michael Schausberger (alle Sportunion Ohlsdorf) gleich 4 Oberösterreicher von insgesamt 11 Aufnahmeplätzen den Sprung in den Kader. Für manche reichte es leider noch nicht ganz, doch auch diese bekamen von U13-ATP-Trainer Roland Brunner einige Arbeitsaufträge in Gesprächen mit den Betreuern mit nach Hause, um an ihrer Technik beim Heimtraining weiter daran feilen zu können und so bei der nächsten Sichtung bessere Chancen zur Aufnahme zu haben.

Insgesamt 33 Teilnehmer aus den verschiedensten Vereinen besuchten die Besprechung. Thomas Hebenstreit informierte zum Thema „Zeitgemäße Vorbereitung auf Training und Wettkampf“ und machte allen Teilnehmern anschaulich klar, dass statisches Dehnen absolut nicht mehr zeitgemäß ist. Weiters wurden durch Andreas Rabel die Neuerungen bei der Mannschaftsmeisterschaft vorgestellt. Bis Ende des Jahres sind Spieler mit B-Mitgliedschaft zulässig. Danach müssen alle Spieler der Mannschaftsmeisterschaft eine A-Mitgliedschaft aufweisen. Neu ist auch die Leihspielerregelung. Ab sofort können in der Bundesliga unbegrenzt viele Leihspieler eingesetzt werden.  Beim Schiedsrichterwesen besteht derzeit ein großer Mangel an Schiedsrichtern. Es sollte einen Pool von ca. 10 – 15 aktiven Schiedsrichtern geben, daher werden Schiedsrichterkandidaten dringend gesucht, mit der Bitte bei Interesse sich an Janos Halasz unter der Mobilnummer 0650 6139789 zu wenden.  Es ist auch in naher Zukunft ein Übungsleiterkurs geplant. Als ablschießenden Höhepunkt präsentierte Markus Benda die neue Homepage www.badminton-ooe.at. Durch mehr und raschere Infos soll ein zusätzliches Interesse für unseren Sport entstehen. Alle Vereine wurden zur Mitarbeit eingeladen. Martin Pilz wurde für die jahrelange Betreuung der OÖBV Homepage gedankt. Derzeit gibt es in Oberösterreich 917 Mitglieder und der OÖBV ist damit der mit Abstand mitgliederstärkste Verband mit einem aktuellen Zuwachs im heurigen Jahr von fast 19%. Das Ziel ist die 1000er-Marke bis zum Jahresende zu erreichen. Der OÖBV freut sich auf konstruktive Kritik und aktive Mitarbeit.</p>","2009-10-01","/content/news/Zahlreiches-Publikum-bei-Sitzung-der-Mannschaftssprecher/5b96c7c44740f.png","5");

Gegen Racketlon Klosterneuburg sah am Samstag alles bereits nach einem Sieg aus, doch letztendlich mussten sich die Alkovener mit einem Remis zufrieden geben. Iris Freimüller gewann ihr Einzel und zusammen mit ihrer aus der Babypause in das Team zurückgekehrten Schwester Tina auch das Doppel. Auch Thomas Hahn spielte stark und gewann das 1. Einzel und das Doppel mit dem erst 15-jährigen Simon Rebhandl. Im entscheidenden Mixed lief bereits alles für die Alkovener Paarung Tina Freimüller /Simon Rebhandl. Der 1.Satz wurde schnell und klar gewonnen, dann aber schlichen sich einige vermeidbare Fehler ein. Die Niederösterreicher wurden immer stärker und konnten die Partie noch knapp im 3. Satz für sich entscheiden. Am Sonntag war WBH Wien zu Gast. In geänderter Formation sah es vorerst nicht recht rosig aus. Leider gingen alle drei Doppelspiele verloren und die Wiener gingen somit 3:0 in Führung.  Dann aber begann eine furiose Aufholjagd der Alkovener. Thomas Hahn, Lukas und Simon Rebhandl und Iris Freimüller gewannen alle Einzelspiele. Damit hing wieder alles am Mixed. Iris Freimüller/Lukas Rebhandl präsentierten sich von Beginn an stark und ließen der Wiener Paarung keine Chance.

Die Nennlisten versprechen spannende Begegnungen und  Österreichisches Spitzenbadminton. Die 53. Staatsmeisterschaften finden vom 5. bis 7. Februar in der Linzer Solar City Halle statt. 96 Spielerinnen und Spieler haben ihre Nennungen abgegeben. Viele spannende Begegnungen sind nicht nur am Finaltag (Sonntag ab 9:00 Uhr) garantiert. Hier die Einzelheiten:Aus Oberösterreichischer Sicht werden die Titelverteidiger im Herrendoppel Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner auch heuer die klaren Favoriten auf den Titel.<br>Den beiden Oberösterreichern stehen allerdings auch die auch stark einzustufende Paarung aus Niederösterreich Roman Zirnwald und Daniel Graßmück vom Tabellenführer der 1.

So kann man gespannt sein, wer dieses Jahr den Titel des Staatsmeisters im Herreneinzel gewinnen wird. Aus Oberösterreichischer Sicht die besten Chancen dürfte Schweiz Legionär Michael Lahnsteiner haben.<br>Im Damendoppel könnte es zu einer Revange für Iris Freimüller (OÖ) gemeinsam mit Tina Riedl (W) und den Titelverteidigerinnen Elisabeth Baldauf (V) und Belinda Heber (K) geben, die sich im Vorjahr im Finale durchsetzten.<br>Im Mixed Bewerb dürfte es besonders spannend werden.

Noch sensationeller gelang dem BSC 70 Linz ein 8:0 gegen den Titelaspiranten aus Kärnten, wodurch die Linzer gleich Pressbaum und Klagenfurt überholen konnten und sich auf Platz 2 der Tabelle wieder fanden. Am Sonntag gelang dann den Linzern ein erwarteter Sieg gegen UBC Vorchdorf, was ihnen für einige Stunden die Tabellenführung brachte, bis Traun sich auswärts gegen WBH Wien mit einem klaren 6:2 Sieg wieder an die Spitze setzte und damit dem Vorjahresmeister aus Wien schon vor dem Halbfinale jede Chance auf eine Titelverteidigung nahm. Die Wiener sind heuer im Halbfinale nur Zuschauer und ganz OÖ träumt von einem Finale ASKÖ Traun gegen BSC 70 Linz, die sich im Halbfinale aufgrund der aktuellen Situation in der Tabelle wohl aus dem Weg gehen werden.</p>","2010-02-26","/content/news/Erfolgreiches-Wochenende-fuer-ASKOE-Traun-und-BSC-70-Linz/5b9754fd4e4da.png","3");

Unsere Halle präsentierte sich am Ende der Semesterferien im besten Licht.<br>Bei der Nennung war bereits abzusehen, dass im Jugendbereich bei den Burschen U19 wieder eine größere Gruppe an diesem Turnier teilnimmt, was in den letzten Jahren nicht so selbstverständlich war.<br>Leider zeichnete sich bei den U19 Damen dieser Trend nicht ab, sodass wir diesen Bewerb nicht austragen konnten. Auch in der Altersklasse U15 der Mädchen waren leider nur 7 Teilnehmerinnen gemeldet, was auf Urlaube während der Semesterferien zurückzuführen war.<br>„Positiv hervorzuheben sind 8 neue Turnierspieler sowie die Tatsache, dass im U11-Bereich mehr Mädchen als Burschen an den Start gingen. Das Niveau einiger der kleinen Ladys überrachte die Zuschauer angenehm!<br>Insgesamt möchte ich bei den „Kleinen“ die SpielerInnen des BC Alkoven hervorheben, die den U11-Bewerb bei den Mädchen (Raup Hannah) und Burschen (Raup Maximilian) gewinnen konnten. Auch  Elena Labmayr blieb bei den U13 Mädchen unangetastet und gewann souverän.“ Bei den Burschen konnte ebenfalls ohne Satzverlust der Favorit Leko Dominik vom ABV Wels den Platz als Sieger verlassen.<br>In den Bewerben U15 und U19 konnten sich die Favoriten durchsetzen und es gab somit hier keine Überraschungen. Der  Ohlsdorfer Michael Schausberger und auch Alexander Serov (Askö Traun)  konnten in Ihren Finalspielen mit zwei Sätzen gewinnen. Einzig Katharina Hochmeir (Union Ohlsdorf) brauchte gegen die Spielerin des BCW Denise Sendlhofer einen dritten Satz.<br>Um ca. 16 Uhr endete unser schönes Turnier in Kirchdorf für alle SpielerInnen verletzungsfrei und mit guter Laune. </p><p>Bericht Andreas PETER<br>Union Spk.

Jakob Ostermann musste sich im Spiel um den Einzug in das Finale des Einzelbewerbes U17 erst im 3. Satz Moritz Kaufmann (V) geschlagen geben, er erreicht so den 3. Platz. Gute Ergebnisse gab es auch in der Altersklasse U19 durch die Doppel Klaus Dornig / Lukas Rebhandl, die den 2. Platz belegten und Florian Baumgartner / Thomas Sturm, die den 3. Platz erreichen konnten. Im Einzel erspielte sich Florian Baumgartner einen Semifinalplatz und belegte zum Schluss den 3. Platz. Die Goldmedaillen machten sich in diesem Jahr Steiermark und Vorarlberg untereinander aus. Gleich dahinter kamen zumindest bei den Burschen die Athleten aus Oberösterreich. Schwierig ist unsere Situation bei den Mädchen, wo wir große Anstrengungen zur Verbesserung der Situation unternehmen müssen. Ansonsten war das Wochenende auch dank der Unterstützung von Jürgen Koch und Yan Yuijang sehr erkenntnisreich.

Im Herrendoppel ging der Titel erwartungsgemäß an die Trauner Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner, die sich im Finale souverän gegen die Niederösterreicher Roman Zirnwald und Daniel Graßmück durchsetzen konnten. Auch Michael Lahnsteiner wurde seiner Favoritenrolle gerecht. Er spielte im Finale gegen David Obernosterer groß auf und holte damit verdient seinen ersten Einzelstaatsmeistertitel. Im Mixeddoppel konnten Niannian Zhou und Jürgen Koch ihren Titel aus dem Vorjahr erfolgreich verteidigen und setzten sich im Finale überraschend klar gegen Simone Prutsch und Roman Zirnwald durch. Im Damendoppel gewann die Oberösterreicherin Iris Freimüller gemeinsam mit der Wienerin Tina Riedl in einer Neuauflage des Finales von 2009 den Titel und konnten sich für die im Vorjahr letztendlich auch durch ein Verletzungspech erlittene Finalniederlage gegen Belinda Heber und Elisabeth Baldauf in drei Sätzen durchsetzen. Im Dameneinzel schließlich kam es zu einer spannenden Begegnung zwischen Simone Prutsch (Weiz, Leihspielerin bei ASKÖ Traun) und Titelverteidigerin Claudia Mayer (Judenburg, Leispielerin beim Veranstalter BSC 70 Linz), die zeitweise an Spannung kaum zu überbieten war. Letztendlich setzte sich die Vorjahresmeisterin Claudia Mayer im 3. Satz klar durch und konnte somit ihren 2. Meistertitel im Einzel holen.<br>Die 53.

In den Einzelbewerben konnte sich diesmal Rebhandl Lukas ausgezeichnet in Szene setzen. Er musste sich erst in einem Super-Finale Gönitzer Markus geschlagen geben, und erreichte so den 2. Platz. Der 9. Platz ging an Simon Rebhandl, der bei seinem ersten Antreten beim B-Turnier eine ausgezeichnete Performance lieferte. Den 10. Platz erreicht Kofler Günter, Jakob Ostermann konnte den 13. Platz erreichen und Grün Manuel belegte den 21. Platz. Super auch die Leistung unserer Mädchen. Fröhlich Maria ereichte den 3. Platz und konnte in einem spannenden Semifinale der späteren Siegerin einen Satz abnehmen. Mit diesem guten Ergebnis hat sie sich für den nächsten Ranglistendurchgang einen Startplatz in der A-Rangliste erkämpft. Überragend war das Abschneiden im Doppelbewerb. Das Finale bestand ausschließlich aus Oberösterreichern. Rebhandl Lukas / Rebhandl Simon traten gegen Ostermann Jakob / Dornig Manuel an. Eines Finales würdig gab es die Entscheidung erst im dritten Satz, den die Borg-Schüler Ostermann/ Dornig für sich entscheiden konnten.</p>","2010-03-08","/content/news/Einige-Podestplaetze-fuer-OOE-Nachwuchsspieler-beim-3-OE-B-RLT/5b9756fac38a1.png","4");

Und die eigentliche Bank der Linzer in den ersten zwei Halbfinalpartien, ging diesmal an ASV Pressbaum, die sich in 2 Sätzen den Sieg im 2. Herrendoppel und damit auch den Sieg in der Halbfinalserie im dritten Spiel beim Stand von 4:4 und 10:8 Sätzen sicherten. Ganz Badminton Oberösterreich hatte sich ein rein Oberösterreichisches Finale gewünscht, aber leider ein Duell Oberösterreich gegen  Niederösterreich bekommen. Die Finalserie beginnt am 24. April 2010 mit dem ersten Finalspiel in Pressbaum und wird am 1. Mai 2010 in Traun in die 2. Runde gehen. Sollte auch im Finale eine dritte Partie nötig sein, so findet diese am 8. Mai 2010 ebenfalls in Traun statt.</p><p>10.4.2010<br>Während Traun im 2. Halbfinalspiel gegen Kärnten mit 5:2 wieder einen klaren Sieg einfährt und damit souverän ins Finale einzieht, muss der BSC 70 Linz im Halbfinalkrimi gegen Pressbaum in die 3. Runde. War es in Linz noch die Mannschaft des BSC 70 Linz, die einen 3:1 Rückstand in einem spannenden und auch nervenaufreibendem Spiel noch in ein 4:4 bei 10:10 Sätzen und 370:368 Punkten Sieg umdrehen konnten, so gelang dieses Kunststück diesmal dem ASV Pressbaum, der nach 3:1 Rückstand mit 4:4 bei 10:10 Sätzen und 376:373 Punkten als Sieger vom Platz ging und damit in der Halbfinalserie auf 1:1 stellte. Damit kann man mit großer Spannung auf das entscheidende Spiel am Sonntag um 15 Uhr in Pressbaum blicken, um zu sehen, wer letztendlich Gegner des ASKÖ Traun um die Meisterschaft sein wird!</p><p>Foto: Christian Biemann<br>Bericht: Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2010-04-10","","4");

Als Außenseiter gingen die Ohlsdorfer in Wien ins Rennen, rechneten aber doch zumindest mit der Bronzemedaille. Die Vorrundenspieler brachten für die Mannschaft Rang zwei in der Gruppe B. Im Halbfinale wartete dann der WBH Wien, der überraschend den Turnierfavoriten aus Klagenfurt besiegte. Eine interessante Begegnung zeichnete sich ab, kannte doch der Trainer der Wiener, Manuel Rösler, die Ohlsdorfer bis ins Letzte. Die Begegnung verlief dann auch äußerst spannend und wurde erst im letzten Spiel, dem Damendoppel, zugunsten der Ohlsdorfer entschieden. Im Finalspiel gegen Pressbaum verliefen die Auftaktspiele extrem spannend, beide Mixdoppel „kippten“ jedoch knapp an die Niederösterreicher. Im Dameneinzel hatte dann Maria Fröhlich den Sieg schon in Reichweite, unterlag aber im dritten Satz knapp Sonja Langthaler. Nachdem Susi Pucher ihrer Gegnerin Lili Greutter zwar ordentlich zusetzte, aber dann doch verlor, war bei den Ohlsdorfern die Luft draußen.

Wir haben gut begonnen, doch die Dänen waren dieses Jahr besser auf uns eingestellt. Ab dem 2. Satz wussten sie meistens, wo ich hinspielen will und dadurch sind mir einige Eigenfehler unterlaufen. Da ich eine längere Turnierpause hatte, fehlt mir vor allem in diesen kritischen Phasen die Spielpraxis. Ein großes Lob an Alex Wong, der uns von hinten angepeitscht hat, und uns nach 8:14 im dritten Satz nocheinmal zurück ins Spiel gebracht hat. Leider konnten wir dann das Spiel ab 14:14 im dritten Satz nicht nach Hause spielen.“ Auch Michael Lahnsteiner unterlag in der ersten Runde.

Der 3. Ober&ouml;sterreicher Michael Lahnsteiner ist etwas sp&auml;ter angereist. Das Turnier ist dieses Jahr sehr stark besetzt, da es nach 1995 wieder auf die Kategorie Grand Prix aufgestuft wurde. Ausgetragen werden die mit 50.000 US-Dollar dotierten Yonex Canada Open im Richmond Olympic Oval, einer riesigen Indoor-Arena. Bei den olympischen Spielen 2010 in Vancouver wurden hier die Eisschnelllauf &ndash;Wettk&auml;mpfe ausgetragen. Unter <a href=\"http://badmintonlife.com/news\" target=\"_blank\">Badmintonlife</a> spricht der ehemalige Spieler und Turnierorganisator Bobby Milroy in einem Interview &uuml;ber die Canadian Open 2010.</p><p>F&uuml;r J&uuml;rgen und Peter ist es seit der EM im April nach einer l&auml;ngeren Turnierpause der erste Vergleich auf internationaler B&uuml;hne. Deswegen sind die beiden Trauner etwas fr&uuml;her nach Vancouver angereist, um sich optimal auf das Turnier vorbereiten zu k&ouml;nnen. Peter Zauner meint vor dem Turnier:&ldquo; Das Turnier ist sehr gut organisiert, da es von einigen ehemaligen Spielern organisiert wird. Das ist immer ein gutes Zeichen. Wir trainieren hier seit Freitag in einer Trainingshalle gleich neben unserem Hotel. Auch die Turnierhalle ist in 10 min. zu Fu&szlig; &nbsp;erreichbar, das ist wirklich sehr gut. Wir befinden uns in einem asiatischen Stadtteil in Flughafenn&auml;he. In diesem Teil Vancouvers gibt es 3 gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Trainingshallen mit 10-15 Feldern. Es spielen eigentlich nur Asiaten und die Hallen sind fast den ganzen Tag ausgebucht. Das ist beeindruckend. Ich sch&auml;tze, dass beim Turnier auch sehr viele asiatische Zuseher kommen werden, &auml;hnlich wie bei den US Open letztes Jahr. Wir haben versucht uns so gut es geht auf das Turnier vorzubereiten. Die Auslosung ist eigentlich nicht schlecht, da wir aber l&auml;nger nicht gespielt haben, sind die Erwartungen nicht all zu hoch. Aber wir werden trotzdem versuchen so weit wie m&ouml;glich zu kommen.&ldquo; &nbsp;Begleitet werden die beiden von Alex Wong, der sie w&auml;hrend des Aufenthalts in Kanada und USA in Punkto Ern&auml;hrung, Motivation und Fitness betreuen wird. &nbsp;Der ehemalige MaXX Restaurantleiter begleitete schon das Team von ASK&Ouml; Traun beim Europacup nach Holland und sorgte bestens f&uuml;r das leibliche Wohl der Spieler.</p><p>F&uuml;r J&uuml;rgen Koch ist Kanada ein guter Boden, da er hier 1994 mit Irina Serova beim damals sehr stark besetzten Welt Grand Prix Turnier den Titel holen konnte. Dieser Sieg z&auml;hlt sicher zu einem der gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Erfolge von J&uuml;rgen Koch und dem &ouml;sterreichischen Badmintonsport. Hier gibt es einen Link zum <a href=\"http://www.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=768B0BF1-EB5C-4900-B33A-BFD58876FC09&draw=4\" target=\"_blank\">Turnierraster</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>J&uuml;rgen Koch:&nbsp;</strong>&bdquo;Amerika und Kanada habe ich sehr positiv in Erinnerung, da ich hier eigentlich immer gut gespielt habe.

ASKÖ Linz, ASKÖ Traun, BC Alkoven und der BC Windischgarsten nahmen für Oberösterreich in verschiedenen Bewerben in allen Altersklassen im Nachwuchsbereich teil. 3 Titel konnten nach Oberösterreich geholt werden. Im DE U11 holte sich Zinganel Lena vom ASKÖ Traun den Titel. Im DD U15-Bewerb waren Dzinic Sejla und Sendlhofer Denise vom BC Wndischgarsten nicht zu schlagen. Eine Klasse für sich waren Serov Alexander und Aigner Daniel ASKÖ Traun/BC Windischgarsten im HD U17. Insgesamt 10 Zweitplazierte und jede Menge 3. Plätze zeigen, dass das Team aus OÖ hervorragend mithalten konnte, auch wenn es nicht immer für den Sieg gereicht hat. Ein hervorragend organisiert und durchgeführtes Turnier ermöglichte allen Aktiven einen guten Start in die neue Saison 2010/2011.

Mit Siegen von Peter Moritz / Christian Putz, Stefanie Riedelberger / Zita Banghegyi, Günter Kofler, Peter Moritz, Christian Putz und Zita Banghegyi konnten die Vorchdorfer die Grazer – immerhin mit 5 Nachwuchsteamspieler, besiegen.</p><p>Am darauffolgenden Sonntag empfing das UBC-Team WBH Wien II. Und auch gegen die starken Hauptstädter behielten die Vorchdorfer die Oberhand. Diesmal punkteten Peter Moritz / Christian Putz, Verena Fastenbauer / Zita Banghegyi, Günter Kofler, Christian Putz, Zita Banghegyi und Dominik Kronsteiner / Verena Fastenbauer. </p><p>Damit liegen die Vorchdorfer nach drei Runden als einziges Team ohne Punkteverlust an der Spitze. „Wer mit diesen Ergebnissen auf uns gewettet hätte, wäre nun reich,“ kann selbst UBC Obmann Harald Starl die beiden Überraschungssiege noch nicht wirklich glauben.</p><p>1.

Der Druck ist nicht so groß unbedingt einen Sieg (oder sogar Siege) einfahren zu müssen.</p><p>Carissa Turner, die in der ersten Runde für den BSC70 spielte, ist mit dem Nationalteam von Wales bei den Commonwealth Games in Deli. Sie steht daher derzeit nicht zur Verfügung.<br>Vieles wird auch davon abhängen wie sich die neuen Spieler bereits eingewöhnt haben. Raj Popat sollte an diesem Wochenende sein ganzes Potential abrufen können und hoffentlich die ersten Einzelsiege einfahren. Bei Österreichs großer Nachwuchshoffnung Matthias Almer wird hoffentlich die Belastung der letzten Wochen nicht zu stark gewesen sein (einige Internationale Turniere) um auch in der Liga gute Leistung zu zeigen. Interessant wird auch das erste Antreten von Andrea Zvorc. (Nr. 149 der Einzel WELT-Rangliste).</p><p><strong>2. Runde – kelag Kärnten – BSC 70 Linz – 09.10.2010</strong><br>„Klagenfurt ist in der eigenen Halle ganz stark. Es ist ihr erstes Heimspiel in dieser Saison und da wird es für uns ganz schwer. In neuer Zusammensetzung ist Klagenfurt für uns vielleicht noch unangenehmer zu spielen als vergangene Saison.<br>Vom Papier sind sie als Favorit zu sehen und im „St. Ruprechter Hexenkessel“ wird sicher der Heimvorteil zu tragen kommen.<br>Zwar konnten wir gegen Ende der Saison mit einem tollem Spiel mit 8:0 gewinnen. Da ist aber alles für uns gelaufen. Im Hinspiel (in Klagenfurt) haben wir aber verloren. Diese Saison – haben wir einen sehr jungen Kader. Iztok Utrosa wechselte von Linz nach Klagenfurt. Es wird das erste Treffen sein. Wir können aber die Stärken von Klagenfurt sehr gut einschätzen.<br>Vor allem konnte man bereits in der ersten Runde (gegen Wolfurt) sehen, dass Klagenfurt auch in dieser Saison wieder zu den Favoriten gehört. Zu hoffen bleibt, dass unser Team wie auch in der ersten Runde gegen Pressbaum bei den Damen punkten kann. Dann ist alles möglich“ spricht Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger. </p><p>Vorbericht – <strong>3. Runde – BSC 70 Linz – WBH Wien 10.10.2010, 11 Uhr Solar City, Linz</strong><br>Wien ist zwar beinahe unverändert zur letzten Saison was die Mannschaft betrifft, aber dennoch ein extrem schwerer Gegner. Auch in diesem Spiel müssen wir wieder auf unsere Damen zählen ohne deren Punkte wird es auch wieder extrem schwer werden.<br>Sie haben 4 starke Herren und 2 starke Damen in ihren Reihen. Staatsmeisterin Claudia Mayer, die die vergangene beiden Saisonen noch in Linz spielte, wird auch hier zum ersten Mal wieder auf ihr „Heimteam“ treffen. </p>","2010-10-08","/content/news/BSC-70-ndash-eine-Niederlage-und-ein-Sieg-am-Wochenende/5b98097c6a180.png","6");

Derby gegen Askö Traun. BSC70 verliert 3:5</p><p>Vor der Begegnung gegen Traun musste man schon wegen Hallenproblemen die Hilfe von den Gästen und dem Magistrat Linz in Anspruch nehmen (durch einen Fehler bei der Hallenreservierung hätte die Partie gar nicht ausgetragen werden können, Stadt Linz und die Vereine halfen durch Hallenwechsel mit).</p><p>Kurz vor dem Spielbeginn am Sonntag dann die nächsten schlechten Nachrichten:<br>Gleich 3 Spieler des BSC 70 Linz mussten kurzfristig ihr kommen absagen.</p><p>Matthias Almer<br>Er war die Tage zuvor bei den Int.

Ihr Heimverband untersagte Ihr das Trainingslager für die Bundesligabegegnung zu verlassen. Sie musste daher in Holland bleiben.</p><p>Carissa Turner<br>Für sie waren bereits die Flugtickets zum Spiel gekauft. Sie musste leider ebenfalls kurzfristig wegen einer Viruserkrankung absagen. Sie kann nicht einmal 5 Meter laufen, danach ist sie völlig fertig. An ein Spiel in der Bundesliga ist nicht zu denken.</p><p>Mit diesen schlechten Nachrichten musste unser Team das Optimum herausholen. An diesem Tag wäre das für uns ein 4:4 unentschieden gewesen.<br>Der BSC 70 setzte alles auf eine Karte um die Punkte zu holen und wollte das 1 Herren Doppel, 2 Herren Einzel und das Mixed holen.</p><p>Daher mussten an diesem Tag auch die „Oldies“ ran. Sogar Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger musste zum Schläger greifen und sorgte sogar im Mixed Doppel für einen 2 Satz Erfolg.</p><p>„Mich freut es persönlich einen Punkt beizusteuern; leider konnten wir den 4. Punkt nicht holen. Das wäre super gewesen“ (Hanka Milisova & Reinhard Hechenberger gewannen 21:16;21:18)</p><p>Raj Popat konnte diesmal im 2. Herren Doppel seinen 1. Sieg in Österreich holen.

Die Spiele heute gaben mir wieder Motivation fürs Training. Ich will im Jahr 2011 zurück zu Mannschaft kommen“ spricht Natalie kurz nach dem Spiel.</p><p>Fazit:<br>Ohne Damenpunkte ist es extrem schwer.<br>„Im letzten Spiel des Grunddurchganges wartet nun Tabellenschlusslicht Feldkirch.

Derby um Punkte. Das „ewige“ Duell in der Badminton Bundesliga zwischen den Serienmeistern Askö BSC 70 Linz und Askö Traun findet die nächste Auflage.</p><p>Der Askö BSC 70 Linz ist mit dem 3. Tabellenplatz derzeit sehr gut positioniert und freut sich auf das OÖ. Derby in der eigenen Halle. Nachdem vor allem Traun in der Bundesliga nicht optimal gestartet ist, geht es in diesem Match schon um sehr viel in Hinblick auf die Play-off Plätze.<br>Überraschenderweise blieben die Ergebnisse bisher aus und Traun ist derzeit sogar nur Vorletzter in der Tabelle.</p><p>„Der Druck liegt sicherlich bei Askö Traun. Sie müssen unbedingt punkten. Gegen uns müssen und werden sie alles geben um den Anschluss nicht zu verlieren“, weiß Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger. </p><p>Die ganze Liga ist sehr ausgeglichen.

Am Samstag war die Mannschaft von Rot Weiß Wien in der Laakirchner Halle zu Gast. Die Ohlsdorfer starteten etwas nervös, war doch ein Sieg notwendig, um dem Tabellenende nicht zu nahe zu kommen. Nach den Doppelspielen und dem ersten Herreneinzel stand es 2:2. Die  restlichen Spiele gingen dann aber teils sehr sicher  nach Ohlsdorf und mit diesem 6:2 Sieg konnte Wien in der Tabelle überholt werden.<br>Am Sonntag war  die Halle mit Zusehern  bestens gefüllt und gleich von Beginn weg herrschte eine tolle Stimmung, gaben doch die Ohlsdorfer in den Herrendoppel gleich den Ton an. Brunner/ Baumgartner gewannen sicher, Wimmer /Sturm mussten sich jedoch im dritten Satz 19:21 geschlagen geben. Das Damendoppel schien eine aussichtslose Sache, standen doch bei Vorchdorf die Ungarin Zita Banhegyi und Staatsmeisterin Miriam Gruber aus Niederösterreich auf dem Feld. Der erste Satz ging auch klar verloren, doch dann legten Riernössl/Sturm den Respekt ab, konnten den zweiten Satz bis zum Schluss offen halten, verloren aber leider 19:21.  Wimmer Thomas stellte mit seinem Einzelsieg wieder den Gleichstand her. Im Dameneinzel spielte Maria Fröhlich  zwar sehenswerte Ballwechsel, musste sich aber klarerweise Miriam Gruber geschlagen geben. Roland Brunner glich dann mit sehr ruhigem und klugem Spiel gegen den Steirer Peter Moritz, zwar knapp aber doch, wieder auf 3:3 aus. Nachdem Sturm Thomas sicher gegen Christian Putz gewann, hofften viele Ohlsdorfer vor dem entscheidenden Mixed Doppel schon auf den vorher nicht erwarteten Sieg. In einem äußerst spannenden Spiel konnten Florian Baumgartner und Brigitta Riernössl mit ausgezeichneten Leistungen und mit einem stimmkräftigen Publikum im Rücken Dominik Kronsteiner und Zita Banhegyi in drei Sätzen bezwingen. Ohlsdorf hat sich mit diesen zwei Siegen nun auf Rang 4 in der Tabelle vorgearbeitet. </p><p>Foto: Roland Brunner<br>Bericht: Sepp Retschitzegger</p>","2010-11-02","/content/news/Ohlsdorf-siegt-gegen-Rot-Weiss-Wien-und-gewinnt-das-Lokalderby-gegen-Vorchdorf/5b980c59cd767.png","5");

Durch das Herabsetzen des Satzendes auf 15 Punkte (Verlängerung bis 18 Punkte) konnte die Turnierleitung des ABV Wels, die von vielen Vereinsvertretern großes Lob für die gute Organisation erhielt, das Turnier um 19.00 Uhr beenden. Doch nun zum Sportlichen. Besonders überraschend war der Sieg von <strong>Denise Sendlhofer</strong> (BC Windischgarsten), die erstmals ihre Vereinskollegin Selja Dzinic im U19-Finale knapp in 3 Sätzen bezwang. Bei den U15-Mädchen konnte sich die U13-Spielerin <strong>Elena Labmayr</strong> (BC Alkoven) schon wie im ersten Durchgang ohne Satzverlust den Siegerpokal holen. Bei den U15-Burschen war es besonders spannend. <strong>Manuel Portenkirchner</strong> (ASKÖ Traun) musste zuerst im Halbfinale seinen Vereinskollegen Florian Fehringer in 3 Sätzen besiegen, ehe er im Finale gegen den Welser Lokalmatador Dominik Leko (ABV Wels), der ebenfalls erst U13-Spieler ist, ebenfalls erst nach 3 Sätzen den Platz als Sieger verlassen konnte. Bei den U19-Burschen konnte erwartungsgemäß <strong>Alexander Serov</strong> (ASKÖ Traun) gewinnen.</p><p>Die Nachwuchsrangliste wurde bereits aktualisiert und die Raster des Turniers gibt es <a href=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/02_OOEBV_U15_JGD_RLT.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">hier</a>.</p><p>Impressionen vom Turnier gibt es auf dem <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/abvwelstv?feature=mhum\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube-Kanal des ABV Wels</a>.<br>Hier das Video eingebettet:</p><p><object height=\"340\" width=\"560\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/51LFX29vSr8?fs=1&hl=de_DE&hd=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></object></p>","2010-12-14","/content/news/Denise-Sendlhofer-siegt-in-Wels-bei-2-OOEBV-U15-JGD-RLT/5b980e69e7c0d.png","8");

Man entschied sich Miha Horvat aus dem Herren Doppel herauszunehmen und hoffte im Einzel einen Punkt einzufahren zu können. Daraus ergab sich für den sportlichen Leiter Andreas Böhm die einmalige Chance in einer Bundesliga Partie anzutreten.<br>Bei seinem Debüt konnte er durch einige schöne Ballwechsel im Herren Doppel an der Seite von Reinhard Hechenberger überzeugen.<br>„Einmal in der Bundesliga anzutreten, das war ein Traum von mir – es war ein schönes Gefühl“ freut sich Andreas Böhm nach dem Spiel.<br>Im 1. Herren Einzel hatte Miha Sepec bereits einige Matchbälle im 2. Satz gegen Jakub Bitmann.

Herren Einzel von Miha Horvat konnte man die erarbeiteten Chancen nicht nützen und musste im 2. Satz trotz Satzbällen diesen abgeben.<br>Im abschließenden Mixed verlor man etwas entnervt den ersten Satz. Am Beginn des zweiten Satzes kam man besser ins Spiel, als beim Spielstand von 4:2 das Spiel unterbrochen werden musste. Tina Riedl (WBH Wien) musste mit Verletzung w.o. geben. Mittlerweile wurde die Diagnose mit Kreuzbandriss gestellt.<br>Das Team des BSC 70 Linz wünscht Tina Riedl alles Gute und baldige Besserung.</p><p>Zukunft des Askö BSC 70 Linz:<br>Für das Play-off ist der Zug für den Askö BSC 70 Linz wohl abgefahren.<br>Mit einem Punkt und einem Spiel mehr als die direkte Konkurrenz ist es praktisch unmöglich, dass man es jetzt noch schaffen kann. Wir werden uns jetzt mit Hochdruck unseren nächsten Zielen widmen.<br>Eine ganz wesentlicher Faktor wird in einer Woche beim Bundesligaforum sein. Dort werden durch alle (in der Bundesliga) beteiligten Vereine die Weichen für die neue Saison gestellt.</p><p>Für den BSC 70 Linz steht aber bereits jetzt schon fest, dass man bei einer geplanten Elite-Liga nicht beteiligen wird.</p><p>Die Meinung von Reinhard Hechenberger dazu: „Dieser Vorschlag (6 Mannschaften und jeweils nur 5 Spiele) ist der größte Schwachsinn der seit langem vorgeschlagen wurde.<br>Wenn man die Nachwuchsförderung abwürgen will, dann mit so einer Regelung. Außerdem gibt es für die anderen Vereine noch weniger Chance in die 1. Liga zu kommen bzw. zu wollen. Sinnvoller wäre da vielmehr ein Kompromiss betreffend Anteil einer Mannschaft an In- und ausländischen Spieler. Das hätte zudem auch einen positiven Effekt bei der Förderung des Nachwuchses. Man wird sehen wie der Kompromiss lauten wird – auf jeden Fall sollte es eine Entscheidung zum Wohle unseres Sportes sein und nicht zum Wohle eines oder einiger weniger Vereine.“</p><p>Vorbericht:<br>In der entscheidenden Phase der Saison muss die Mannschaft leider auf 4 Stützen verzichten.</p><p>Die Nr. 1 bei den Herren – Raj Popat – fehlt wegen Achillessehnenriß und arbeitet derzeit täglich in der Reha für ein mögliches Comeback im Herbst 2011</p><p>Unser TOP-Nachwuchsspieler – der 17 jährige Matthias Almer – fällt weiter wegen Bauchmuskelzerrung aus. Er spielte souverän das 3. Herren Einzel und war bereits ein wichtiger Faktor der Mannschaft.</p><p>Manuel Grün und Christoph Almer befinden stehen derzeit ebenfalls nicht zur Verfügung. Beide arbeiten nach Knieproblemen (ua. Kreuzbandverletzung) am Comeback im Team. </p><p>Für die Mannschaft besonders bitter, da sie durch diese Ausfälle ihre Taktik komplett umstellen muss. Bisher konnte der BSC 70 mit dem zweiten und dritten Herren-Einzel regelmäßig punkten. </p><p>Durch den Ausfall von Raj Popat und Matthias rücken andere Spieler auf und es wird für den BSC 70 sehr schwierig, das bisherige Niveau zu halten. </p><p>Mit der dezimierten Mannschaft wird es extrem schwierig Punkte für den Play-off Platz zu holen.</p><p>Die derzeitige Position ist noch sehr gut. Sollte der BSC 70 vor allem gegen seinen direkten Gegner WBH Wien – nicht punkten können, wird es wohl in dieser Saison nichts mehr mit dem Erreichen des Play-off Halbfinales.</p><p>„Auf jeden Fall werden wir um jeden Punkt kämpfen“ sagt Obmann Hechenberger.</p><p>Zum Team muss auch dieses Mal Harald Hochgatterer stoßen. Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger muss ebenfalls zum Schläger greifen. Letzterer erhöhte zuletzt auch wieder die Trainingseinheiten um dem Team zu helfen.</p><p>Bericht: Reinhard Hechenberger/Redaktion</p>","2011-01-28","/content/news/1-Bundesliga-keine-Punkte-fuer-den-BSC-70-Linz-am-Wochenende/5b980fd871fc5.png","4");

Nationalspielerin Miriam Gruber zog sich eine Muskelverletzung zu und konnte nicht spielen – Peter Moritz quälte sich nach seiner Erkrankung – musste am Sonntag gegen Graz zusehen. Im Heimspiel gegen Verfolger Mödling gingen die Vorchdorfer durch Dominik Kronsteiner / Günter Kofler mit 1 : 0 in Front. Danach folgten drei Niederlagen zur 3 : 1 Führung der Niederösterreicher.

Im Hinspiel gab es einen knappen 5 : 3 Sieg für Kronsteiner & Co. </p><p>Am Sonntag, 9. Jänner 2011 bestreitet UBC Vorchdorf dann das vorentscheidende Spiel gegen ATSE Graz auswärts. Obwohl die Vorchdorfer das Heimspiel gewinnen konnten, sind die Grazer mit fünf Nachwuchsnationalspieler klarer Favorit und liegen verdient an der Tabellenspitze. </p><p>Leichte Sorgen bereiten dem Team nach wie vor die zuletzt ersatzgeschwächten Spieler auf Grund von Krankheiten. „Die Vorbereitung war nicht optimal – die Jungs müssen vorerst mal wieder gesund werden,“ bangt UBC Obmann Harald Starl um den Einsatz von Moritz, Weber und Putz. „Wenn wir ungeschlagen über die Runden kommen, wäre ich schon zufrieden,“ hofft Starl jeweils auf ein Remis.</p><p>Bericht: Harald Starl</p>","2011-01-03","/content/news/2-Bundesliga-Sieg-und-Niederlage-fuer-UBC-Vorchdorf/5b9812467251a.png","4");

Wir müssen am Wochenende zumindest 2 Punkte holen um aus eigener Kraft die Qualifikation zu schaffen. Aufgrund der zuletzt gezeigten Leistungen ist dieses Vorhaben durchaus realistisch.

Davon können auch die Badminton Asse vom UBC Vorchdorf ein Lied singen.<br>Souverän spielte das junge Team bislang in der Saison – wäre da nicht das Derby gegen Ohlsdorf. Im erstmals ausgetragenen Salzkammergut Derby unterlagen die Vorchdorfer im Herbst unglücklich mit 3 : 5 gegen den Nachbarn.</p><p>„Wir haben noch eine Rechnung offen,“ polterte UBC Obmann Harald Starl vor dem Spiel. Doch die vielen Ausfälle wegen Verletzungen und Krankheiten dämpften die Stimmung in Vorchdorf gewaltig. Mit den Ex-Staatsmeistern Miriam Gruber, Verena Fastenbauer und Peter Moritz musste das UBC Team gleich auf drei Topspieler ausgerechnet im Derby verzichten. Dazu kamen noch drei angeschlagene Akteure.</p><p>Spannung bis zum letzen Ballwechsel – ganz nach dem Geschmack der vielen Fans – zeigte das Spiel dann selbst. Vorchdorf ging in Führung – Ohlsdorf glich aus. So ging es bis zum 2 : 2. Dann der befreiende Doppelschlag durch Dominik Kronsteiner und Zita Banghegyi – die Vorchdorf mit 4 : 2 in Front schossen. Ohlsdorf kam nochmals auf 3 : 4 heran, ehe das Mixed von Manuel Weber / Stefanie Riedelberger die Entscheidung zum vielumjubelten 5 : 3 Sieg fixierte.</p><p>„Auf Grund der vielen personellen Probleme bin ich über den Sieg sehr glücklich,“ strahlte Starl nach dem Spiel. „Ein tolles Spiel in dem beide Teams auf eigene Spieler setzten.“ Made in Austria hatte den Vorrang.</p><p>Mit dem Sonntagspiel gegen Alkoven stand für UBC das nächste OÖ. Derby auf dem Programm. Gegenüber dem Vortag mussten die Vorchdorfer mit Christian Putz wegen Erkrankung einen weitern Spieler vorgeben. So getrübt die Stimmung bereits vor dem Spiel war – so war sich auch während und danach. „Die Luft war einfach draußen,“ sah Starl ein völlig anderes Spiel seiner Mannschaft. Eine bittere 2 : 6 Niederlage war die Folge – übrigens erstmals gegen Alkoven. Lediglich Dominik Kronsteiner und Zita Banghegyi konnten in ihren Einzelspielen überzeugen und die Ehrenpunkte erkämpfen. </p><p>Während ATSE Graz eine Runde vor Ende der Meisterschaft als Meister feststeht, hat auch UBC Vorchdorf den Vizetitel sicher.

Der „neue“ Modus ist aber auch auf die Neuerungen und Gesprächsrunden bei den letzten Mannschaftsführerbesprechungen zurückzuführen.<br>Auch das Rahmenprogramm (Players-Party und Tombola) kamen bei den Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmern gut an und so war die ganze Veranstaltung von einem fröhlichen, gemeinschaftlichen aber auch sportlich fairen und hart umkämpften Miteinander der OÖ Badminton Gemeinde geprägt.

Die Mannschaft braucht die Unterstützung ihrer Fans um für diese schwere Aufgabe Höchstleistungen zu erbringen.<br> Spitzenleistungen werden auch erforderlich sein, um das Dutzend an Mannschaftstitel zu komplettieren. ASV Pressbaum hat den Grunddurchgang klar beherrscht und ist dadurch auch der Favorit. Aber aufgrund der zuletzt gezeigten  Leistungen rechnet sich die Mannschaft um Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner gute Chancen aus. Jedenfalls ist Badminton der Spitzenklasse und gute Unterhaltung garantiert.“</em></p><p><strong>Der Abend wird von ORF Reporter Wolfgang Hüttner moderiert.Rahmenprogramm:<br> Profitanzgruppe, Promi-Badminton, Gratis-Verlosung,</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Der Eintritt ist frei!</strong></p><strong> </strong><p></p><p><br></p><p>Der Kader:<br>Huang Haoda, Jürgen Koch, Peter Zauner, Markus Ratzenböck, Klaus Dornig, Harald Koch,<br>Marina Andrievskaia, Barbara Scheer, Karola Reifetshamer</p><p>Bericht: Herbert Koch</p>","2011-04-19","/content/news/ASKOE-Traun-schafft-die-Grundlage-zur-Titelverteidigung-und-gewinnt-gegen-ASV-Pressbaum-52/5b9818694a4fe.png","6");

Platz auf den Malediven und einem sehr guten Spiel gegen die Dänen Kristiansen/ Bonde in der Quali der Singapore Open sind wir nun in Jakarta angekommen. Gleich am Flughafen und bei der Fahrt zum Hotel merkt man, dass Badminton die Nr. 1 Sportart im Land ist, überall sieht man Werbeplakate von Badmintonspielern oder vom Turnier selbst. Die Indonesian Open sind heuer ein Premier Super Series Event, das heißt die höchste Kategorie die es im Badminton nach WM und Olympia gibt. Dementsprechend stark ist das Turnier auch besetzt. Wir spielen am Dienstag um ca. 14:00 Ortszeit (MEZ + 5h) gegen die Indonesier Kurniawan/Windarto. Normalerweise sind in Indonesien bereits in der Quali viele Zuseher, das heißt die Stimmung wird super sein auch wenn viele der Zuseher für die Einheimischen klatschen werden. Wir haben seit den Singapore Open sehr gut  mit Spielern aus anderen Nationen wie z.B.: Polen, Holland, Kanada und England… trainiert. Es wird sicher kein leichtes Match werden, aber wir werden alles zu geben und versuchen zu gewinnen. In der 2. Quali-Runde würden wir auf die Deutschen Fuchs/Roth oder die Chinesen Shen/Hong treffen. Auch das ist eine sehr schwere Aufgabe, aber bei den Premier Super Series Turnieren gibt es sowieso keine leichten Gegner. Seit den Singapore Open unterstützen uns Alex Wong (ehemaliger Restaurantleiter im MaXX21) und sein Freund Bert Reschenhofer aus Braunau. Dadurch werden uns viele Dinge erleichtert, sei es organisatorisch oder auch beim Anfeuern in der Halle. Ein großes Dankeschön an die Beiden, die seit einem halben Jahr eine Asienreise machen. Sie sind extra zu den beiden Turnieren in Singapur und Indonesien geflogen, um uns zu unterstützen.<br> Infos dazu findet ihr unter: www.goodfeelings.atem>“</em></p>","2011-06-20","/content/news/Indonesien-Open-2011-Peter-ZaunerJuergen-Koch-gegen-Chinesen-ausgeschieden/5b981c60a4cda.png","4");

Wir hatten praktisch keine Zeit um uns ordentlich einzuspielen. Viel schlechter ging es einer Teilnehmerin im Dameneinzel. Als sie in der Halle eintraf, war ihre Gegnerin bereits als Siegerin gewertet gewesen. Umso mehr freut es uns, dass wir uns gegen die Kanadier, die ebenso als Olympiakandidaten einzustufen sind, durchgesetzt haben. Heute haben wir sicher eines unserer besseren Spiele abgeliefert, obwohl der Beginn des Matches alles andere als einfach war. Für morgen werden wir die Organisationsprobleme vor Ort einkalkulieren.

Juni haben wir unsere heurige Asientour mit dem Abflug in Linz begonnen. Nachdem Peter aufgrund seiner Verletzung lange Zeit außer Gefecht war, mussten wir immerhin 2 Jahre warten, um wieder einmal in Asien spielen zu dürfen.  Die Vorfreude war natürlich riesengroß, denn dieses Jahr gilt es auch wichtige Punkte für die Olympiaquali zu sammeln. Die ersten beiden Turniere der Olympiaquali konnten wir mit einem 2. und 3. Platz in Slowenien und Spanien relativ gut bestreiten. Wir haben uns auf diese Asientour sehr gut vorbereitet und hoffen, dass wir dieses Jahr viele Weltranglisten-Punkte mitnehmen können. Aber auch das Training mit den besten Doppelspielern der Welt ist für uns sehr wichtig, da wir selten mit Weltklassespielern trainieren können.<br> Die ersten 3 Tage haben wir damit verbracht uns gut zu akklimatisieren, Krafttraining zu machen und in der Halle zu trainieren. Gestern hatten wir noch einen sehr schönen Ausflug zu einem wirklich traumhaften Resort auf den Malediven, das von der Hauptstadt Malé nur 15 min. mit dem Speedboat entfernt war. Die Fahrt mit dem Speedboat war schon ein Riesenerlebnis, aber auch die Insel entschädigt für die vielen harten Trainingsstunden. Unser erstes Spiel bestreiten wir heute um 20:30 Ortszeit (17:30 MEZ) gegen Yang/Ramirez aus Guatemala. Wir freuen uns schon drauf, obwohl es sehr heiß ist in der Halle und es keine Klimaanlage gibt. Aber daran gewöhnt man sich nach einiger Zeit.<br> Von dem Rest des österreichischen Teams ist noch Michi Lahnsteiner dabei, er konnte bereits 2 Runden gewinnen und trifft im Achtelfinale auf Karunaratne aus Sri Lanka heute um 19:00 Ortszeit.

Auch der Sieg war möglich, deswegen sind wir kurz nach dem Spiel etwas enttäuscht, da wir in letzter Zeit oft sehr gut spielten, aber nicht gewinnen konnten. Wir wissen aber auch, dass es vor allem von unserem Spielniveau her weiter nach oben geht. Wenn wir jetzt weiter dran bleiben, werden wir auch die nötigen Siege gegen Spieler auf diesem Niveau einfahren können. Die letzten 4 Turniere hatten wir nur Top Paarungen als Auftaktgegner, wenn unser Ranking weiter wie bisher nach oben geht, sollten wir auch bessere Auslosungen bekommen und erst später im Turnier auf die starken Paarungen treffen. Dann sieht es bezüglich der Qualifikation für Olympia 2012 in London nicht so schlecht aus. Leider können wir bei der WM in 2 Wochen nicht starten, da wir zum Qualifikationszeitpunkt Mai erst  4 Turniere in der Wertung hatten. Unser nächstes Turnier wird Anfang September in Europa sein. Bis dahin gilt es die gute Form zu halten und eventuell noch auszubauen. Wir blicken nach den Turnieren im Sommer durchaus sehr positiv in die Zukunft.“</em></p><p>______________________________________<br><strong>Vorbericht von Peter Zauner:</strong><br>„<em>Nach einem sehr guten Spiel bei den US Open gegen Fang und Lee (Weltrangliste Nr.7), in dem wir leider 3 Satzbälle vergaben, haben wir seit dem Ausscheiden sehr gut mit dem deutschen Nationalteam trainiert. Leider haben wir auch bei den Canadian Open mit den Chinesen Liu/Qiu (#6) eine sehr schwere Auslosung erwischt. Wir fühlen uns jedoch mittlerweile dank unserer guten Form und dem vielen Aufwand, den wir dafür betrieben haben, im Stande, auch gegen solche Gegner zu gewinnen. Das Spiel startet Mittwoch um 20:40 Uhr Ortszeit (Donnerstag, 5:40 Uhr in Österreich).<br> Bitte drückt uns wie bisher die Daumen, danke“</em></p><p>Bild: Offizielles Plakat der Yonex Canada Open 2011/ Jürgen und Peter mit der deutschen Nationalmannschaft</p>","2011-07-20","/content/news/Yonex-Canada-Open-2011-ZaunerKoch-verlieren-Marathon-Match-in-3-Saetzen/5b981dd9c603a.png","4");

Gleich 7 Bundesmeistertitel, dreimal Silber und dreimal Bronze holten vergangenes Wochenende die SpielerInnen des ASKÖ Badmintonverein Wels in Maria Enzersdorf (NÖ) bei den diesjährigen ASKÖ Bundesmeisterschaften, die mit ca. 150 Teilnehmern trotz heißem Wetter und somit unangenehmen Temperaturen in der Halle sehr gut besucht waren. Herausragendster Spieler war diesmal Dominik Leko (U13) – er wurde dreifacher Bundesmeister und gewann alle Bewerbe (Einzel, Doppel und Mixed) ohne einen einzigen Satz abzugeben. Philipp Benda (U15) wäre beinahe das gleiche geglückt, hätten ihm im Einzelfinale nach einem souveränen ersten Satzgewinn nicht die Nerven einen Strich durch die Rechnung gemacht. Weiters konnten sich auch Celina Benda (U13 / Doppel), Lena Schwetz (U15 Doppel) und Luka Leko (U13 / Doppel) als ASKÖ BundesmeisterIn küren. “Wir können echt stolz auf unser bisher bestes Ergebnis bei ASKÖ Bundesmeisterschaften sein. Dieser Erfolg ist sicher auch unserer gelungenen Vorbereitungsphase in den Sommermonaten zu verdanken.”, so der glückliche Obmann Markus Benda, der auch selber in seiner Altersklasse im Einzel Silber holte.

Vor allem im samstägigen Spiel gegen Wolfurt wann man nicht schlecht unterwegs. Nachdem wir das 1. Herren Doppel in 3. Sätzen gewonnen hatten, hatten wir ein wenig Hoffnung, dass dieses Begegnung gegen Wolfurt vielleicht ein, für uns, gutes Punkteergebnis bringen könnte.<br> Dies deshalb, weil die Spiele von Manuel Berger gg. Mathias Bertsch erst im dritten Satz mit 21:19 entschieden wurde.<br> Manuel kämpfte gegen den Nationalspieler super und hatte das richtige Rezept um seinen Gegner in Schwierigkeiten zu bringen.<br> Leider unterliefen ihm bei 19:19 zwei blöde Fehler und die Partie war dahin.<br> Gleiches musste auch unser Jüngster Flo Baumgartner verspüren. Er kämpfte und überrasche wohl alle mit seiner starken Partie gegen die Nr. 1 der österreichischen Einzelrangliste Rene Nichtewitz.<br> Nach dem Gewinn des ersten Satzes brachten wiederum nur ein paar Unkonzentriertheit zum Ende der Sätze die Entscheidung für den Gegner.<br> Leider blieb die tolle Leistung unbelohnt und Flo verlor im dritten Satz mit 18:21.<br> Somit gingen das 2.+3. Herren Einzel knapp aber doch an die Wolfurter.<br> Auch im Mixed konnte die neue Paarung Maria Fröhlich/Miha Horvat gegen die Wolfurter Paarung im ersten Satz toll überraschen.<br> Sie gewann 22:20 und zeigten, dass auch hier etwas drinnen ist.<br> Gegen Wien war wohl der Köper wie auch Geist leer.<br> Keiner unser Spieler konnte an die Leistungen vom Samstag anschießen. Auch mit einer anderen Aufstellung als gestern konnten wir nicht die erhofften Punkte einfahren.<br> Fazit:<br> Die Mannschaft weiß, dass sie besser ist als die Ergebnisse darstellen.<br> Die knappen Ergebnisse gegen die starken Wolfurter zeigen auch, dass wir mit der jungen Mannschaft auf einem richtigen Weg sind.<br> Ihnen gilt die Zukunft und Ergebnisse sind derzeit nicht im Fokus unseres Team.<br> Vielmehr wollen wir die Entwicklung der jungen Mannschaft vorantreiben.<br> Morgen geht´s weiter mit Training um hoffentlich für das Spiel gegen Pressbaum in 3 Wochen eine weitere Steigerung erreichen.“</em></p><p>_____________________________________________<br>Vorbericht:<br>Gleich zu Beginn der neuen Saison geht es in der 1. Bundesliga wieder voll zur Sache.</p><p>Am kommenden Wochenende findet die Doppelrunde gegen Wolfurt und WBH Wien statt.</p><p><strong>Sa. 15.10.2011, 15 Uhr – Askö BSC 70 Linz – UBC Wolfurt – AHS Solar City Linz<br> So. 16.10.2011, 11 Uhr – Askö BSC 70 Linz – WBH Wien – AHS Solar City Linz</strong> </p><p>Am Sa. 15.10.2011 findet ab 15 Uhr in der AHS Solar City Halle in Linz das erste Heimspiel des BSC 70 der Saison statt.</p><p><em>„Wir werden alles daran setzen auch gegen Wolfurt ein starkes Spiel zu machen. In der ersten Runde mussten wir uns nur knapp Klagenfurt geschlagen geben.<br> Wolfurt ist in dieser Saison durch ihre Neuverpflichtung stärker als in den vergangenen Saisonen einzuschätzen. Unsere junge Mannschaft wird alles geben.<br> Wolfurt wird in dieser Begegnung wohl eine Nummer zu groß für den BSC 70 Linz sein. Wir werden mit Sicherheit bis zum Schluss um jeden Punkt kämpfen</em>“, meint Reinhard Hechenberger vor der Begegnung gegen Wolfurt.</p><p>Gegen Wien am Sonntag wird der BSC 70 vor derselben Situation stehen, dass er eher Außenseiter sein wird.<br>Die junge Mannschaft kann zeigen was in ihr steckt und vielleicht gelingt ihr eine Überraschung.</p><p>Lassen wir uns von beiden Begegnungen an diesem Wochenende überraschen und begeistern.</p><p>Bild: Neuverpflichtung – Nika Koncut<br>Bericht: Reinhard Hechenberger</p>","2011-10-13","/content/news/1-Bundesliga-Askoe-BSC-70-Linz-gegen-WBH-Wien-und-UBC-Wolfurt-endet-mit-2-Niederlagen/5b9822c9433ee.png","5");

Und es wurde ein Kampf um jeden Punkt. Während es gegen WBH Wien noch zu einem 4 : 4 Unentschieden reichte (Punkte: Thomas Wimmer, Dominik Kronsteiner, Zita Banghegyi und Stefanie Riedelberger / Zita Banghegyi), mussten sich die Vorchdorfer gegen Vorjahrsmeister ATSE Graz knapp mit 3 : 5 geschlagen geben.

Die Vorchdorfer müssen jedoch auf ihre Topspielerin Miriam Gruber verzichten – die Ex-Staatsmeisterin ist für ein Jahr aus beruflichen Gründen nach Guatemala verreist. Stefanie Riedelberger und Verena Fastenbauer, die somit ein Comeback im UBC Team feiert, werden in den folgenden Spielen abwechselnd das Damenduo mit Zita Banghegyi bilden.

Runde der diesjährigen OÖ Mannschaftsmeisterschaft ist gespielt. Es fallen diesmal ein paar Dinge auf. Es hat sich anscheinend noch nicht richtig herumgesprochen, dass Änderungen in den Meisterschaftsterminen umgehend im Sekretariat des OÖBV zu melden sind, damit keine Strafen anfallen. Dies gilt auch für Probleme beim Eintragen eines Ergebnisses, auch hier sollte das OÖBV Sekretariat umgehend informiert werden, dass auch hier keine Strafe anfällt. Was auch auffällt, die Kontrolle durch die Auswärtsmannschaft findet auch selten ein Häckchen. Und was meiner Meinung nach gar nicht geht: Eine 2.Mannschaft eines Vereins in einem Derby gegen die 3. Mannschaft des Vereins dürfte niemals unvollständig antreten, wenn die 3. Mannschaft in der gleichen Partie vollständig antritt. Dies ist zwar im Sinne der Wettspielordnung nicht verboten, aber auch nicht so vorgesehen.<br>Ich erinnere mich da an Zeiten, bei denen die 2. Mannschaft eines Vereins nicht vollständig in einer Liga antreten konnte und die 3. Mannschaft hatte bereits in der Klasse unterhalb gespielt mit einer vollzähligen Mannschaft.<br>In der Zeit gingen dann beide Spiele W.O. an die Gegner, da immer nach oben aufgerückt werden musste. Ich hoffe so eine „Verwindung“ der Kräfteverhältnisse habe ich das letzte Mal in dieser Meisterschaft gesehen.</p><p>Ich wünsche mir eine Meisterschaft bei der Taktik innerhalb eines Vereins bei Derby Begegnungen keine Rolle spielt und Klassenerhalt und Aufstieg aus eigener Kraft ohne Punktegeschenke passieren.

In den weiter unten liegenden Spielklassen zeichnen sich einige spannende Duelle um die Herbstkrone ab. Der BSC 70 Linz 3 in der 1. Klasse Nord und Union Urfahr 2 in der 2. Klasse Nord/West sollten die Herbstrunde als jeweils Tabellenführer beenden können. Durch die Aufstiegsregelung für die Meister der 2.

Am erfolgreichsten einmal mehr Katharina Hochmeir von der Sportunion Ohlsdorf. Mit Siegen im Einzel und Doppel (gemeinsam mit Vereinskollegin Jana Haas) sowie den 2. Platz im Mixed (mit Partner Phillip Vogl / Kelag Kärnten), konnte sie einmal mehr ihre Stärke in Österreich unter Beweis stellen.

Für eine kleine Überraschung sorgte auch Axel Kolbeinsson (Nr. 6 / ASKÖ Linz), der im Halbfinale seinen oberösterreichischen Kontrahenten Michael Schausberger (Sportunion Ohlsdorf) klar in zwei Sätzen bezwang.

Das Turnier wurde mit der Mixed-Siegerehrung um 20:45 Uhr beendet.<br>In der Sporthalle Haid lieferten sich 32 Herren-Doppel, 13 Damen-Doppel und 26 Mixed-Doppel<br>auf 6 Spielfeldern faire, spannende und schweißtreibende Spiele.<br>Zwischendurch war ein Glückshändchen gefragt um aus 98 Losen das richtige zu ziehen.<br>Für 25 Spieler(Innen) gab es eine kleine Aufmerksamkeit und alle anderen bekamen ein Lächeln geschenkt.<br>Die ersten drei Doppelpaare wurden mit Gold, Silber und Bronze Medaillen belohnt, sowie die Viert platzierten  bekamen die Balisto Medaillen.<br>Wie schon beim 1. OÖBV-Doppelturnier in Vorchdorf war die Jugend ist nicht zu bremsen und so konnten die Mädels vom BC Windischgarsten und die Jungs von Union Kirchdorf ihren Sieg wiederholen. Im Mixed war die Familie Mauhart nicht zu schlagen.<br>Die Auflistung der Besten vier Paarungen, alles andere ist in der Tournamentsoftware ersichtlich.</p><p><strong>2.

Landesliga Nord und die 2. Klasse Süd positiv erwähnt werden, denn dort wurden alle Ergebnisse von der jeweiligen Gastmannschaft auch bestätigt.</p><p>Was auch auffällt sind die oft komischen Aufstellungen, bei denen von 8 Partien gleich 3 quasi nicht gespielt werden. Ich hoffe zumindest, dass bei diesen Begegnungen auch alle Spieler und Spielerinnen wirklich SPIELBEREIT waren. Bei den angegebenen Ergebnissen scheint mir das fragwürdig. Zur Erklärung: SPIELBEREIT ist ein Spieler (eine Spielerin) dann, wenn sie in voller Spielkleidung und ohne offensichtlicher Verletzung am Beginn der Begegnung in der Halle bzw. am Spielfeld erscheint.<br>Verletzungen beim Einspielen, Aufgaben und dergleichen sollten im Kommentar vermerkt werden, damit das aus dem Spielbericht ersichtlich ist.</p><p>Nun zu den Halbzeitführenden: In der 1. Landesliga hat sich dann doch noch der BSC 70 Linz gegen den direkten Rivalen Union Ohlsdorf nicht zuletzt auch wegen der „Ohlsdorfer“ Verstärkung durchgesetzt und sich die Halbzeitführung erkämpft. Überraschend ist nach der Hinrunde ASKÖ Traun nicht zuletzt wegen eines Nichtantretens gegen Union Ohlsdorf Letzter. In der 2. Landesliga zeichnen sich sowohl in Nord (SK VÖEST, ASKÖ Pasching und Union Braunau) also auch in Süd (BC Windischgarsten und UBC Vorchdorf) durchaus knappe Entscheidungen an der Tabellenspitze ab. In den beiden 1. Klassen ist trotz der 5 Siege des BSC 70 Linz sowohl in Nord als auch in Süd (1. Union<br>Ohlsdorf) für die Verfolger durchaus noch einiges drinnen. Immerhin steigen der Meister der 1. Klasse zum letzten Mal in die 2. Landesliga auf. In den 2. Klassen ist sicher noch einiges offen. Es gibt allerdings in jeder jeweils einen Halbzeitführenden ohne Punkteverlust. In Nord/West liegen mit Union Urfahr II und Union Urfahr III beide Mannschaften eines Vereins auf den beiden ersten Plätzen.</p><p>In Kürze wird sich die Ligakommission wieder mit der Aufstellung der einzelnen Vereine auseinandersetzen. In der Hinrunde haben sich durchaus einige Ergebnisse ergeben, die durchaus eine Umreihung der Spieler nach sich ziehen werden. Ebenso wird sicher das eine oder andere Mal der eine oder andere Spieler (Spielerin) nach hinten gereiht, weil er (sie) in der Hinrunde nicht eingesetzt wurde.</p><p>Zum Schluss noch ein Hinweis in eigener Sache: Am 18.12.2011 findet wieder das traditionell recht gut besetzte OÖ Doppelranglisten Turnier in Linz statt. Diesmal mit einem ganz besonders attraktiven Preis für die Sieger (Siegerinnen) der einzelnen Bewerbe.</p><p>Nun wünsche ich allen LeserInnen dieses Artikels noch einen schönen restlichen Advent, ein besinnliches Fest und wieder viel Erfolg für 2012.<br>Bis bald nach der 6. Runde … </p><p>Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2011-12-10","/content/news/Aus-den-Ligen-geplaudert-hellip-nach-Runde-5/5b98f976c7cd6.png","5");

Im Einzel konnte einmal mehr Lukas Fröhlich (Sportunion Ohlsdorf) den hervorragenden 3. Platz erzielen. Im B-Bewerb der Burschen waren es vor allem die jungen Schülerspieler Philipp Benda (6.

Die Generalversammlung hat im letzten Sommer die neue Richtung vorgegeben.<br>Vor allem hat man einen großen Schnitt in der 1. Mannschaft herbeigeführt und mit der Verpflichtung junger, ambitionierter Spieler einen neuen Weg eingeschlagen.<br>Diesen Spielern, wie auch der gesamten Bundesligamannschaft, gilt das Vertrauen der nächsten Jahre. Sie will man aufbauen und an die (österr.) Spitze heranführen. Ob und wie uns das gelingen wird, werden wir sehen. Dass wir aktuell nicht im Spitzenfeld<br>der Bundesliga mitspielen ist mit einkalkuliert, derzeit aber auch nicht anders möglich. Die Spieler zeigen, trotz der teilweise knappen Niederlagen, starke Leistungen, wurden aber noch nicht sehr oft mit einem Sieg belohnt. Im Fokus steht derzeit die Spielpraxis für<br>die „Jungen“ um möglichst viel Erfahrung sammeln zu können.<br>Deshalb werden unsere Aufstellungen nach dieser neuen Ausrichtung gewählt. Die jungen Spieler können derzeit auch viel von den erfahrenen Spielern lernen und wir hoffen, dass sie davon auch profitieren werden. Nachdem es auch keinen Absteiger aus der 1. Bundesliga geben kann (weil die Liga nicht mit 8 Mannschaften voll belegt ist) können wir auch ohne großen Druck spielen.</p><p><strong>Bericht: 8. Runde – Wolfurt – Askö BSC 70 Linz  –  8:0</strong><br>Am Wochenende fand die 8.

Geburtstag feierte.</p><p>Und die jüngste im Team (Maria Fröhlich – 18 Jahre) zeigte gleich zu Beginn gegen Alexandra Mathis (Anschlussspielerin zum Nationalkader des ÖBV) stark auf.<br>Sie machte ein gutes Spiel im ersten Satz und gewann sensationell mit 21:17.<br>Alexandra stellte dann ihr Spiel um und konnte 2. +3. Satz für sich entscheiden.<br>Zu seinem Bundesligadebüt kam gestern Daniel Mikl. Er sprang für den verletzten Harald Hochgatter ein. Als Einzelspieler musste er gestern in die Doppelspiele gehen, zeigte aber auch hier gute Leistungen.<br>Der Rest der Mannschaft tat sich trotz teilweise guten Leistungen recht schwer, vor allem konnten die Einzelspieler jeweils erst im 2. Satz gut dagegen halten.<br>Vor allem vermeintlich leichte Fehler in den entscheidenden Situationen müssen reduziert werden um diese Spiele dann auch mal gewinnen zu können.</p><p>Vorschau: 9.

Wie schon im vergangenen Jahr, übernimmt der OÖBV die Turnierraster und legt auch heuer wieder Wert darauf, dass nicht gesetzte SpielerInnen in jedem Bewerb mindestens 2 Partien spielen können. Ausrichter Verein ist diesmal der BSC 70 Linz. Zum ersten Mal wird versucht, die Allgemeine Klasse am ersten Tag fertig zu spielen. Dies hängt zwar auch von der Anzahl der Nennungen ab, aber der Versuch Allgemeine Klasse und Senioren auch vom Turniertag her zu trennen, liegt nicht zuletzt auch darin, dass am 2. Tag bei den Halbfinali und Finali in den letzten Jahren stets W.O.<br>Partien dabei waren. Als erfahrener Turnierveranstalter unter der Oberaufsicht des OÖ Schiedsrichterreferenten Klaus Mitterhauser werden sicher wieder spannende Qualifikationsgruppen und auch K.O.

Nachdem die Beiden das Spiel am Beginn des ersten Satzes bis 13:11 dominierten, kamen die beiden Amerikaner und Ex-Weltmeister Tony Gunawan/ Howard Bach auf und in den Spiel-Rhythmus. Die Begegnung endete letztendlich mit 21:13 und 21:16 für Gunawan/ Bach. Für die beiden Trauner stehen jetzt noch 2 Trainingstage in Malaysia auf dem Programm, dann geht es zurück nach Österreich, wo bereits am Dienstag, 17. Jänner 2012 in Traun das Länderspiel gegen Deutschland stattfindet.<br><strong><br> Kommentar von Koch/Zauner nach dem Spiel:</strong><em>“ Einerseits können wir mit der Leistung phasenweise zufrieden sein, doch wir müssen solche Spiele auf höchstem Niveau auch einmal gewinnen, um mit dem nötigen Selbstvertrauen in die nächsten Matches gehen zu können. Wir sind jetzt nach den 2 1/2 Wochen in Korea und Malaysia wieder sehr gut in Form und werden versuchen daraus bei den Turnieren in Europa Kapital zu schlagen. Hier in Asien sind die Bedingungen für Badminton einfach perfekt. Die Medien berichten in Zeitungen und im Fernsehen täglich vom Badmintongeschehen.Die Stadien bei den Turnieren sind gefüllt mit tausenden Zusehern. Das ist eine einzigartige Atmosphäre und die Vielzahl an Weltklasse – Trainingspartnern hilft uns immer unser Spielniveau zu steigern. Es gilt jetzt diese Form mit nach Europa zu nehmen und mit sehr guten Ergebnissen doch noch auf den Olympiazug aufzuspringen.“</em></p><p>________________________________________________<br>Vorbericht:<br>Bei den mit 400 000 US-Dollar dotierten Malaysian Open, treffen Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner ab Mittwoch in der 1. Runde auf Tony Gunawan und Howard Bach (Nr. 19 der Weltrangliste). Der für die USA spielende Indonesier Gunawan gilt als einer der besten Doppelspieler aller Zeiten und holte gemeinsam mit seinem Partner Howard Bach 2005 das erste WM-Gold für die USA. Als er noch für Indonesien spielte, erreichte er neben zahlreichen Turniersiegen bei großen Events auch Olympiagold 2000 in Sydney. Die beiden Oberösterreicher profitierten als Nr. 1 der Qualifikation von der Absage der Top-Gesetzten Koreaner Lee Yong Dae und Jung Jae Sung. Koch/Zauner (Nr. 37 der Weltrangliste) starten deswegen bei dem sehr starken Super Series Event im Hauptbewerb. </p><p>Kommentar der beiden zur Auslosung:<br><em>„Zuerst einmal sind wir froh, dass wir ins Hauptfeld gerutscht sind. In Malaysia ist Badminton eine der wichtigsten Sportarten und es ist immer eine Super-Stimmung in der Halle. Wir haben gegen Gunawan/ Bach schon einmal im Finale der US-Open gespielt und verloren. Vielleicht können wir uns hier in Kuala Lumpur revanchieren, was in Blickrichtung Olympia sehr wichtig wäre.“</em></p><p>Bericht: ASKÖ Traun</p>","2012-01-10","/content/news/KochZauner-verlieren-zum-Auftakt-der-Malaysian-Open/5b98fd1371a78.png","5");

Zu den Ausfällen kommt auch noch viel Spielpech, sodass die UBC-Schützlinge beide Heimspiele verloren. </p><p>Das UBC Team kämpft und fightet – doch am Ende verlassen die Spieler mit hängenden Köpfen das Spielfeld. Allein achtmal sollte an diesem Doppelrunden Wochenende der 3. Satz entscheiden – und ebenso oft verloren die UBC-ler den Entscheidungssatz. Letztlich mussten sich die Vorchdorfer im Derby gegen Alkoven mit 2 : 6 geschlagen geben, wobei Günter Kofler und Dominik Kronsteiner für die Punkte sorgten. </p><p>Gegen den Tabellenführer aus Feldkirch hatten die Heimischen abermals ihre Chancen – aber lediglich Dominik Kronsteiner konnte sein Einzel gewinnen.

Jänner 2012, 15 Uhr, Sporthalle) sind die Heimischen ebenso wie gegen Herbstmeister Feldkirch (Sonntag, 8. Jänner 2012, 10 Uhr, Sporthalle) Außenseiter. Erschwert wird die Situation noch zusätzlich durch den Ausfall von Verena Fastenbauer, die an einer Meniskusverletzung laboriert. Damit ist die Aufholjagd des UBC stark eingeschränkt. „Wir waren in dieser Saison nicht gerade vom Glück übersät gewesen – aber nun beginnt das  neue Jahr wieder mit einer Seuche,“ ärgert sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl vor dem Rückrundenstart.

Schade, dass wir nach guten Phasen aufgrund einiger Eigenfehler nicht in die Nähe eines Satzgewinn gekommen sind.

Runde zusammenfassen. Da mittlerweile klar ist, dass Union Urfahr das Unternehmen 2. Bundesliga wieder aufgibt, entsteht in der 1. Landesliga erneut ein großes Gedränge um den 3. Platz, denn auch der Viertplatzierte muss in die 2. Landesliga absteigen. Zurzeit ist das ATSV Steyr, das mittlerweile punktegleich mit Union Windsichgarsten mit einem etwas schlechterem Spiel und Satzverhältnis knapp dran ist, den Klassenerhalt vielleicht doch noch zu schaffen. Sowohl Steyr als auch Windischgarsten haben in den verbleibenden Runden den im Moment Tabellenletzten zum Gegner.<br>Steyr bekommt es in Runde 7 mit dem Tabellenführer BSC 70 Linz zu tun, das Spiel endete in der Hinrunde 6:2 für die Linzer. Windischgarsten bekommt es hingegen mit dem Tabellenzweiten Ohlsdorf zu tun, das Hinspiel endete auch hier 6:2 für die Ohlsdorfer. In der Runde 10 spielen die beiden Mannschaften von ATSV Steyr und Union Windischgarsten dann im direkten Duell gegeneinander um den Klassenerhalt. Das Hinspiel gewann Steyr auswärts mit 5:3. Wird also wirklich spannend werden. Freilich kann alles ganz anders kommen und beide Mannschaften bleiben in der 1. Landesliga, wenn wieder eine Mannschaft in die 2. Bundesliga aufsteigen möchte. Zurzeit sieht es aber nicht danach aus und so bleibt das ganze ziemlich spannend. </p><p>Bis bald …<br>Klaus Mitterhauser </p>","2012-02-28","/content/news/Aus-den-Ligen-geplaudert-hellip-nach-Runde-7/5b98fe11e288e.png","4");

Ebenso knapp ging es bei bei den Mädchen ab.<br>Die Unterstufe wurde einen Tag später in der großen Halle des BG Kirchdorf gespielt. Sehr enttäuschend war hier die Teilnehmerzahl. Der Sieg vom Stiftsgymnasium Wilhering war zwar hart erkämpft, aber letztendlich verdient. </p><p>Bericht: Sepp Retschitzegger</p>","2012-02-17","/content/news/OOE-Schulcup-2012/5b98fe6be42a6.png","5");

Schade auch, dass leider wieder von keinem „neuen“ Verein dieses Turnier genutzt wurde, um neue Jungen und Mädchen ins Turnierspiel einzuführen.<br>Es waren wieder „nur“ die Traditionsvereine in der Jugendarbeit bei uns zu Gast: Ss Alkoven, Bc und Union Windischgarten, Wels, Ohlsdorf, Altmünster, Bsc Linz, Vorchdorf, Askö Linz, Traun und Kirchdorf stellten die Teilnehmer.<br>Nur Teilnehmer aus 11 der 29 oberösterreichischen Vereine sind leider aber etwas wenig.<br>Vereine wie Neuhofen, Schlierbach, Grünburg oder der 2 BL Verein Urfahr müssten da vielleicht noch etwas mehr in die NW Arbeit einbezogen werden.<br>Leider konnten wir auch den U11er Damenbewerb mangels Teilnehmerinnen nicht durchführen. Lediglich der ABV Wels hatte hier eine Nennung abgegeben.<br>Das Turnier verlief dann aber planmäßig und so konnten ab 16 00 die Finalspiele gespielt werden.<br>Die U11 Herren gewann hier im Finale Ohlsdorf gegen Ohlsdorf Schausberger Stefan gegen<br>Traugott Florian, Dritter wurde der Askö Linzer Eidenberger Marvin.<br>Die Damen U13 beherrschten die Spielerinnen des ABV Wels , so gewann Mairhofer Hannah in zwei Sätzen vor ihrer Vereinskollegin Celina Benda.

Schwetz Lena (ABV Wels) konnte im kleinen Finale mit 21:7, 21:12 ihren dritten Platz souverän erkämpfen.<br>Bei den Herren U15  setzte sich der Favorit Luka Leko (ABV Wels) im durchaus spannendem Finale mit Nußbaumer Lukas (U. Altmünster) mit 21:18, 21:14 durch und gewann Gold. Fehringer Florian vom Askö Traun  im Spiel um Platz drei ließ Michael Mittermayr (SS Alkoven) keine Chance und errang Bronze mit 21:8, 21:9.<br>Jana Haas matchte dann das erste drei Satz Finale! In einem sehr spannenden Match konnte sich die kleine, große Ohlsdorferin dann den Goldpokal der Damen U19 gegen Selja Dziniz erfighten.<br>Eine andere Ohlsdorferin, Nadine Reiter, schlug in einem nicht minder spannenden kleinen Finale, dann die Schwester von Selja, Eldina Dziniz.<br>Lukas Mizelli war im Finale der Herren U19 nicht zu schlagen. Daniel Walchshofer, BSC 70, nahm dem Kirchdorfer in seiner Heimhalle einen Satz ab, konnte dann aber im dritten Satz nicht mehr mithalten. Das sehr spannende Match begeisterte mit seinem Ergebnis von 21:19, 21:23 und 21:11 trotzdem und wurde zum Höhepunkt des Turniertages.<br>Parallel dazu musste sich unser Philipp Mayr dem Windischgarstner Schauer Christian in Match um den dritten Platz geschlagen geben.<br>Um 17:15 Uhr waren alle Ehrungen vergeben und unser Turnier zu Ende.</p><p><strong>Die Platzierungen:</strong></p><p><strong>U19 HE</strong><br>Mizelli Lukas – U.

Rein von den Ergebnissen fällt diesmal nichts Besonderes auf.<br>Die Leader nach der Hinrunde in den einzelnen Ligen setzten sich in der 6. Runde gegen den jeweiligen Gegner (mit einer Ausnahme: Ohlsdorf 3 in der 1. Klasse Süd mit einem 4:4 gegen Kremsmünster) durch. Einen Patzer hätte sich fast auch Union Urfahr 2 gegen Union Urfahr 3 geleistet, denn das Ergebnis war denkbar knapp und bis zum letzten Spiel offen. Trotzdem endete es letztendlich mit 5:3 für die 2. Mannschaft. Soweit die auffälligsten Ereignisse der Runde 6.<br>Mittlerweile muss man als Beobachter feststellen, dass die Ergebnisse doch relativ zeitnah auch bereits online sind, was eine schöne Entwicklung darstellt.<br>Durch einzelne Gespräche bei den Doppelturnieren habe ich festgestellt, dass nicht allen Vereinsverantwortlichen die Aufstiegsregelung für 2012/2013 aus den 2. Klassen klar ist. An dieser Stelle werde ich diese Aufstiegsregelung noch einmal erklären. Zwei der 4 Meister der zweiten Klassen haben die einmalige Chance von der 2. Klasse in die Bezirksliga aufzusteigen. Diese Direktaufsteiger werden in 2 Relegationsspielen der Form. Die Sieger aus den Begegnungen Meister Nord gegen Meister Mitte bzw. Meister Mitte/Süd gegen Meister Süd steigen direkt in die Bezirksliga auf, die Verlierer steigen in die erste Klasse auf. Das Heimrecht für die angegebenen Begegnungen wird gelost.<br>Was sich auch in den letzten Monaten gezeigt hat, ist der große Zulauf zu den OÖ Doppelturnieren abseits der Ligen. Hier könnte vielleicht eine kleine Änderung im Spielmodus eine Entlastung der Turniere in Bezug auf die Anzahl der Spiele insgesamt eine Verbesserung bringen. Dabei würde ich mir wünschen, dass Anregungen von Seiten der Teilnehmer kommen. Eine Möglichkeit wäre etwa, das Teilnehmerfeld in 16 Gruppen zu unterteilen, was die Gesamtanzahl der Matches bei großer Teilnehmerzahl wesentlich verringert und damit auch die Anzahl der möglichen Ausrichter wieder erhöht. Anregungen bitte entweder als Kommentar oder direkt an mich zu richten. Im Zuge der Saisonabschlussbesprechung wird das sicher ein Programmpunkt. </p><p>Bis bald …<br>Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2012-02-06","/content/news/Aus-den-Ligen-geplaudert-hellip-nach-Runde-6/5b99000b6d191.png","4");

Runde, melde ich mich vor Beginn der letzten Meisterschaftsrunde noch einmal. Vieles in der Meisterschaft scheint bereits entschieden. So zum Beispiel der Landesmeistertitel, der fix vergeben ist, wenn der BSC 70 Linz mit einer vollständigen spielbereiten Mannschaft zum letzten Spiel nach Ohlsdorf kommt. Ebenso scheinen auch die Absteiger fix zu sein. Im Kampf um den 3. Platz und damit sicheren Verbleib in der 1. Landesliga ist für Union Windischgarsten die einzige Devise: „Verlieren verboten!“ oder hoffen, dass sich auch heuer wieder eine Mannschaft aus der 1. Landesliga in das Unternehmen 2. Bundesliga wagt.</p><p>In den vier 2. Klassen kristallisieren sich die Gegner der beiden Aufstiegsspiele heraus:<br>Es werden das wohl Union Urfahr II gegen ASV Nettingsdorf II  bzw. Union Altmünster gegen BC Windischgarsten II sein, wenn auch ASV Nettingsdorf II und BC Windischgarsten II noch nicht ganz fix als Meister der jeweiligen 2.<br>Klasse feststehen.</p><p>Für die Vereinsverantwortlichen heißt es nun auch überlegen, wie viele Mannschaften in der kommenden Saison die Meisterschaft bestreiten sollen. Es kommen ja mit der neuen Bezirksliga doch einige Neuerungen auf die Meisterschaft zu. Es bleibt auch zu hoffen, dass die Anzahl der Mannschaften nicht geringer wird. Vielleicht kommt die eine oder andere Mannschaft auch noch dazu und belebt das Meisterschaftsgeschehen.</p><p>Eine spannende Saison neigt sich dem Ende zu und ich hoffe ich sehe viele von Euch bei der Saisonabschlussbesprechung, die gleichzeitig mit der Generalversammlung des OÖBV sattfindet. </p><p>Auf bald … Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2012-03-27","/content/news/Aus-den-Ligen-geplaudert-hellip-nach-Runde-9/5b99019ca4d1a.png","6");

Wir werden gegen die Chinesen voll riskieren , nur so haben wir eine kleine Chance. Da es für alle Asiaten schon das 3. Turnier in Europa ist, hoffen wir auf die Sensation, da sie oft eine kleine Schwäche zeigen, wenn sie sich so lange in Europa aufhalten.“</em></p>","2012-03-15","/content/news/Swiss-Open-in-Basel-Koch-Zauner-fuer-starke-Leistung-nicht-belohnt/5b9902a3e418e.png","6");

ÖBV B-Ranglistenturnier statt.<br>Hier wurde erstmals der Versuch gestartet, am Samstag lediglich Einzel und Doppel zu spielen und am Sonntag Einzel und Mixed. Für die Spielerinnen und Spieler brachte das sicherlich den Vorteil, dass die Einzel am 2. Tag nicht dem Kräfteverschleiß des ersten Tages zum Opfer fielen. Dies zeigte sich vor allem darin, dass nahezu zwei Drittel der gesamten Spiele an beiden Tagen erst im 3. Satz entschieden wurden. Der erhoffte Zeitgewinn am Ende des ersten Tages konnte leider nicht beobachtet werden, da die durchschnittliche Spieldauer der einzelnen Spiel aufgrund der Ausgeglichenheit des Teilnehmerfeldes wesentlich höher war, als im Vorfeld angenommen.</p><p>Spielende am ersten Tag war etwa 20:10 Uhr (Ende Herrendoppel Finale).

Wiederrum waren die Partien von oft knappen Ergebnissen gekennzeichnet, sodass die Einzelfinale erst gegen 13:45 Uhr zu Ende ging.<br>Erstaunlich war aber auch die Tatsache, dass im Mixed Doppel trotzdem noch ein Teilnehmerfeld von 14 Paarungen um den Titel kämpfte.

NachwuchsspielerInnen aus dem Ländle vom 3. Ö. SCH-RLT in Dornbirn nach Hause. Gleich 8 Bewerbsiege und nicht weniger als 20 Stockerlplätze konnten die OberösterreicherInnen ergattern, wobei noch einige „heiße Eisen“ zu Hause bleiben mussten, da sie sich schon fix in der Jugend-Rangliste etabliert haben und somit nicht mehr spielberechtigt waren. Allen Erfolgen voran, die Alkovnerin Elena Labmayr. Sie holte in allen drei Bewerben ihrer Altersklasse (U13) den Turniersieg und darf mächtig stolz darauf sein. Auch Michael Schausberger (Sportunion Ohlsdorf) durfte sowohl im Einzel als auch gemeinsam mit Doppelpartner Yutoka Amann (Vorarlberg) im Doppel ganz oben auf dem Siegespodest Platz nehmen. Nicht zu vergessen auch die B-Bewerbe, bei denen dieses Mal Lukas Mittermayr (U15/BC Alkoven) und Gregor Radner (U13/Sportunion Kirchdorf) den Sieg holten. Für den 8 Bewerbsieg sorgte Philipp Benda gemeinsam mit Mixed-Partnerin Antonia Meinke (Niederösterreich) im U15-Mixed-Bewerb. Wir gratulieren unseren erfolgreichen OÖ.

Mannschaft rund um Kapitän Christian Klement hat in der obersten Spielklasse OÖ (1. Landesliga) den 4. Endrang (von 6 Mannschaften) erreicht. Damit wurde formal der Klassenerhalt fixiert, wobei es durch mögliche Absteiger aus der Bundesliga noch zu einem Abstieg kommen kann. Besonders bitter war hier eine unerwartete 3:5 Heimniederlage in der letzten Runde gegen den direkten Konkurrenten Union Windischgarsten. Obwohl man von der Papierform (und auch aufgrund des 5:3 Sieges bei der Auswärtspartie) als Favorit in die Begegnung ging, gab es einen überraschenden Spielverlauf. Plangemäß gingen die Doppelspiele mit 2:1 an Steyr. Berger Manuel/Hofreiter Wolfgang gewannen ebenso klar wie Pöllhuber Markus/Tomsovic Arthur verloren. Das Damendoppel Walter Marion/Kloihofer Christa siegten schließlich in 3 Sätzen, wobei nur die ersten beiden Sätze knapp waren.<br>Somit mussten die Einzelspiele die Vorentscheidung bringen. Walter Marion siegte innerhalb kürzester Zeit und ließ ihrer Gegnerin nur 9 Punkte in 2 Sätzen. Gänzlich anders verliefen die Herreneinzel, die allesamt über 3 Sätze gingen und leider auch allesamt verloren wurden. Bitter dabei die erste Saisonniederlage von Berger Manuel, der als regierender Landesmeister gegen den Nationalspieler Rebhandl Lukas verlor. Vorentscheidend war die Niederlage von Pöllhuber Markus, der im Entscheidungssatz mit 21:23 in der Verlängerung das Nachsehen hatte. Zusätzlich verlor auch noch Klement Christian sein Einzel und damit war der Kampf um den 3. Tabellenrang zugunsten von Windischgarsten entschieden. Das letzte Mixed war ein Spiegelbild der Gesamtbegegnung, es ging wieder über 3 Sätze und auch diese Begegnung verloren die Steyrer Letz Andrea/Klement Christian.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.e-steyr.com/fotos/badminton-steyr-vs-windischgarsten\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Fotogalerie</strong></em></a></p><p>Die 2. Mannschaft rund um Kapitän Arthur Tomsovic startete in der 2. Klasse Süd mit dem Ziel, möglichst lange im Aufstiegsrennen zu bleiben. Dies gelang auch bis zum Schluss und man beendete die Saison auf Rang 2, auch hier hinter einer Mannschaft aus Windischgarsten, diesmal BC Windischgarsten II.  Die vorentscheidende Begegnung in der vorletzten Runde wurde auswärts mit einem Unentschieden bestritten, wobei man aufgrund eines kurzfristigen verletzungsbedingten Ausfalles nur mit 3 Herren antreten konnte und damit schon kampflos mit 0:1 in Rückstand geriet. Aber die Mannschaft ATSV Steyr II konnte sich mit einem klaren Sieg in der letzten Runde gegen ATSV Steinbach/Grünburg den 2. Gesamtrang sichern. Für die nächste Saison ist das Projekt Aufstieg klar angepeilt und die gesamte Entwicklung der Mannschaft im heurigen Jahr lässt viel Hoffnung für die nächste Saison zu. </p><p>Folgende SpielerInnen sorgten in der Saison für die Punkte in der Mannschaft von Kapitän Arthur Tomsovic: Berger Melanie, Zaunmayr Dani, Scheichl Tina, Huemer Gottfried, Hofer Martin, Pilz Martin, Felbauer Karl, Maunz Thomas,  Austaller Christian, Schmid Erik, Kerscher Robert</p><p>Bericht: ATSV Steyr</p>","2012-04-06","/content/news/1-LL-ATSV-Steyr-ndash-Niederlage-in-Runde-10-gegen-Union-Windischgarsten/5b99061d9061c.png","4");

In der Vorrunde gab es für das Team, bestehend aus Hochmeir Kathi, Haas Jana, Nadine Reiter, Schausberger Michael und Benjamin Ploberger (Leihgabe aus Kirchdorf) einen klaren Sieg gegen eine Slowenische Mannschaft. Beim Spiel um den Gruppensieg gegen ein rumänisches Team mussten sich die Ohldorfer Mannschaft denkbar knapp 2:3 geschlagen geben, wobei Kathi und Benjamin ihre Spiele erst in der Verlängerung verloren. Die restlichen Begegnungen wurden dann wieder gewonnen und der vierte Platz gesichert. Mit etwas Glück in der Vorrunde wäre hier viel möglich gewesen. Dieses Turnier war ein toller Abschluss einer zwar sehr anstrengenden aber auch sehr erfolgreichen Saison. Nach einer kurzen Pause steht nun ein sehr intensives Sommertraining auf dem Programm, um auch in der neuen Saison ähnlich erfolgreich zu sein.</p><p>Bericht: Sepp Retschitzegger</p><p> </p>","2012-07-03","/content/news/4-Rang-beim-int-Wienerwald-Mannschaftsturnier-fuer-Ohlsdorf/5b9909592465e.png","8");

Liga wagte.</p><p><strong>Play-off Einführung</strong><br>Mit dieser Saison wird neben dem Meister Play-off auch ein mittleres- und Abstiegsplay-off (wieder) eingeführt.

Als einziges Team blieb diese Mannschaft unverändert zur letzten Saison. Aufgrund der gezeigten Leistungen, sind die Vorarlberger, aus Sicht von Reinhard Hechenberger, die Favoriten.</p><p>Die Spitzenteams der kommenden Saison werden aus Hechenbergers Sicht ASV Pressbaum, Askö WBH Wien I und Askö Kelag Kärnten sowie der Askö BSC 70 Linz I werden.<br>Durch die Abgänge von Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner, beide gingen in die deutsche Bundesliga, ist das Team der Trauner in dieser Spielzeit erstmals seit einigen Jahren etwas schwächer einzuschätzen.

Der Meister der vergangenen Saison ist, auch mit geänderter Mannschaft, noch immer Favorit. Es macht den Start in die neue Saison nicht einfacher.</p><p>Für uns ist es das erste gemeinsame Treffen in dieser Saison. Wir konnten durch die vielen Termine (Weltmeisterschaften, individuelle Turniere der Spieler) keine gemeinsame Vorbereitung absolvieren. An sich haben wir für die 1.

Jamnik Kek, welcher auch International das Racket schwingt, wird seinen ersten Auftritt in der österreichischen Bundesliga haben. Bei den Damen wird die Österreicherin Sarina Kohlfürst die Premiere für das Team des BSC 70 Linz feiern.</p><p>Ziel für unser Team ist ein Unentschieden.“</p><p><strong>Vorbericht – 1. Runde –Askö BSC 70 Linz I – BC Alkoven – 13.10.2012</strong></p><p>Hechenberger dazu:</p><p>„Für unser „Juniorteam“ wird es kommendes Wochenende spannend. Zum ersten Mal in der Vereinsgeschichte geht es mit einer 2. Mannschaft in die Bundesliga. Die Statuten erlauben uns eine Teilnahme in der 1. Bundesliga sowie in der 2. Bundesliga.</p><p>Im 2. Team kommt es zum Auftritt von Alexander und Andrej Serov. Die Eltern (Irina & Vladimir) standen vor 20 Jahren in der ehrwürdigen Europameisterschafts-Mannschaft, welche 1992 den einzigen Titel einer österr. Mannschaft holte. Die beiden Brüder wechselten von Traun nach Linz und wollen sich in der 2. Bundesliga an die österreichische Spitze und auch in die 1. Bundesliga spielen. Ein Antritt in der 1. Bundesliga ist für die beiden aber in dieser Saison nicht geplant. Daniel Mikl, Daniel Walchshofer und Christoph Kainrath werden am kommenden Wochenende in unserer 2. Bundesligamannschaft debütieren.<br>Bei den Damen wird Natalie Hofinger, Steffi Peter und Ursula Edelmüller antreten. Verletzungsbedingt fällt  Karin Seebacher leider aus.</p><p>Unterstützen wird dieses Team auch Routinier Harald Hochgatterer.</p><p>Es ist ein sehr enges Match zu erwarten. Alkoven hat eine ausgeglichene, gut zusammengespielte Mannschaft. In der vergangenen Saison erreichten sie den 4. Platz der 2. Bundesliga. Es wird nicht leicht für uns werden. Ziel für unser Team ist ein Unentschieden.“</p><p>Bericht: BSC 70 LInz</p>","2012-10-10","/content/news/BSC-70-Linz-startet-mit-UEberraschungssieg-in-der-1-Bundesliga/5b990d007936b.png","8");

Die Spiele verliefen relativ klar, allerdings nur im HE2 mit dem besseren Ausgang für Traun: Wolfgang Gnedt siegte gegen Vilson Vattanirappel. Rüdiger Gnedt ging im HE1 zwar über 3 Sätze, musste sich aber am Ende doch geschlagen geben.</p><p><strong>Askö BSC 70 Linz I</strong><br>Den Spielern des Askö BSC 70 Linz I gelingt es derzeit nicht die entscheidenden Spiele zu gewinnen. Wie auch bei den Spielen gegen Wolfurt und Wien vor 2 Wochen schaffte es der BSC nicht, den „Sack“ gegen ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten zuzumachen. Dies führte zur knappen, „unglücklichen“ 3:5-Niederlage gegen einen der Gegner um die Play-off Plätze. Neuzugang Sarina Kohlfürst konnte sich bereits toll in die Mannschaft integrieren und zeigte mit 2 Siegen sehr gute Leistungen im DD und im DE.</p><p>Nach einem Sieg über Pressbaum verbleibt Wolfurt mit 4 Siegen in 4 Runden an der Tabellenspitze.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 1. Bundesliga</em></a></p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga:</strong><br><strong>BSC 70 II</strong><br>Die Vorzeichen für die Partie Feldkirch – BSC 70 Linz II standen schlecht, da bei den Damen Nina Almer und Natalie Hofinger fehlten. Auch bei den Herren musste verletzungsbedingt auf Andrej Serov verzichtet werden, dafür war Daniel Walchshofer doch fit für einen Antritt in der 2. Bundesliga. Den einzigen Sieg konnte Harald Hochgatterer im HE2 einfahren. Im DD schrammten Ursula Edelmüller und Steffi Peter knapp an einer Sensation vorbei: Obwohl die Beiden bisher kein einziges mal miteinander gespielt hatten, konnten sie beinahe den ersten Satz gewinnen. Doch sie konnten eine 19:15 Führung nicht nützen. Im HD2 konnten Walchshofer/Mikl ebenfalls eine 18:16 Führung nicht zum Satzgewinn vollenden. Die restlichen Spiele gingen relativ klar zugunsten von Feldkirch aus. Einer der Hauptgründe dafür waren vor allem sehr viele Eigenfehler der BSC-Spieler. Ballsicherheit und Timing sollen in den kommenden Trainings am Programm stehen.</p><p><strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong><br>Im 1. Heimspiel der Saison gelang den Vorchdorfern keinerlei Überraschung – gegen den ungeschlagenen Leader AS Mödling gab es die erwartet klare 1:7 Niederlage. „Die Niederösterreicher sind heuer das Maß der Dinge in der Liga,“ so UBC Obmann Harald Starl. Angeführt von Nationalspieler Daniel Graßmück waren die Mödlinger in allen Belangen den Vorchdorfern überlegen. Den Ehrenpunkt erspielte Dominik Kronsteiner durch einem 21:18 21:17 Erfolg im Einzel. Eine zufriedenstellende Leistung boten Manuel Weber / Thomas Wimmer im HD1 sowie Thomas Petzold / Brigitta Riernössl im Mixed, die sich nur knapp geschlagen geben mussten.</p><p><strong>BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven</strong><br>Als einzige oö. Bundesliga-Mannschaft fuhr der BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven einen Sieg ein: Dieser fiel (auswärts) in der Bundeshauptstadt gegen den WBH Wien II mit 7:1 unerwartet hoch aus. Das Ergebnis zeigt aber nicht den wahren Spielverlauf auf, immerhin wurden 3 Matches erst knapp im 3.Satz erfolgreich beendet. Der 2.Tabellenplatz wurde damit jedenfalls erfolgreich verteidigt! Zum ersten Mal trat die Ohldorferin Maria Fröhlich für die Alkovener an und sorgte gleich für einen Krimi. Maria bot eine kämpferisch starke Leistung und siegte im 3. Satz nach einer Nervenschlacht mit 22:20. Auch Lukas Rebhandl hatte die besseren Nerven und gewann ebenso erst im 3.Satz 22:20. Einen weiteren knappen Erfolg feierte das Doppel Thomas Hahn/Simon Rebhandl. Sie mussten ebenfalls in einen 3.Satz, diesen beendeten sie aber klar mit 21:14. Die restlichen Partien verliefen eindeutig. Iris Freimüller war nicht ganz fit und wurde nur im Mixed eingesetzt. Der Sieg war aber nie gefährdet. Mario Gerstl wurde ebenfalls zum ersten Mal eingesetzt und gewann mit Lukas Rebhandl das 2.Doppel. Überraschend leicht kam auch das erstmalig zusammen spielende Damendoppel Maria Fröhlich/Maria Steinmann zu Erfolg. Nur Christoph Lessl konnte an seine zuletzt ausgezeichnete Form nicht ganz anknüfpen. Er musste sich seinem stark spielenden Gegner geschlagen geben.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 2.

Derby der <strong>1. Bundesliga</strong> setzte sich der BSC 70 Linz mit 6:2 gegen die Gäste vom ASKÖ Traun durch. Die Mannschaft unter Führung von Andi Böhm war optimal auf Traun eingestellt und konnte alle entscheidenden Spiele für sich gewinnen. Für die erste Mannschaft des BSC bedeutet der Sieg einen großen Schritt Richtung Meister-Play-off (Platz 4 der Tabelle). Der ASKÖ Traun verbleibt sieglos auf dem letzten Tabellenplatz.</p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga:</strong> Der UBC Vorchdorf „kann doch noch siegen“ (wird in der Presseaussendung mitgeteilt). Im Heimspiel feierten Kronsteiner & Co. einen knappen 5:3-Sieg und überholten damit die Wiener in der Tabelle. Das engste Spiel der Runde lieferte sich jedoch mit Sicherheit Alkoven auswärts im Ländle gegen die punktegleichen Feldkirchner. 7 der 8 Partien gingen über 3 Sätze, mit dem besseren (5:3) Ergebnis für die Spieler vom BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven. Alkoven stellt damit für die kurze Winterpause den 2. Tabellenplatz sicher. Tabellenführer bleibt Mödling, die in den 5 Begegnungen nur 3 Matches abgaben – in der letzten Runde leider auch keines gegen den BSC 70 Linz II (0:8). </p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 1.

Bundesliga</em></strong><br>Der ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten bestritt in dieser Doppelrunde die Auswärtsmatches gegen die oö. Erstligisten. Am Samstag empfing Tabellenletzter <strong>Traun</strong> die Gegner aus dem Süden. Wolfgang Gnedt machte im zweiten Herreneinzel den Trauner Ehrenpunkt gegen Dominik Trojan. Die anderen Spiele verliefen knapp, aber doch in zwei Sätzen zu Ungunsten der Trauner. Spannender war für Traun die Sonntagsbegegnung mit dem WBH Wien. Harald Koch und Rüdiger Gnedt mussten sich im zweiten Herrendoppel undankbar mit 20:22 20:22 geschlagen geben, und auch die Damen verloren ihr Doppel erst im dritten Satz. Rüdiger und Wolfgang Gnedt zeigten sich einzelstark und konnten ihre Partien zugunsten von Traun entscheiden. Leider blieb es bei diesen beiden Siegen und Traun trennte sich von WBH Wien mit 2:6. Traun ist damit fix im Abstiegs-Play-Off.<br>Das Ziel des <strong>BSC 70 Linz</strong> war klar: Ein Sieg gegen Pressbaum und ein Unentschieden gegen Kärnten reichen für das Meister-Play-Off. Es kam anders, aber im Endeffekt nicht schlechter. Die Pressbaumer setzten sich in vier Herrenspielen durch und sicherten sich damit ein Unentschieden. Das BSC-Team glänzte bei den Damen und konnte das Unentschieden immerhin halten. Eher unerwartet, aber umso mehr erfreulich dann die Sonntagsbegegnung: Wieder spielten die Damen des BSC Sarina Kohlfürst und Nika Koncut stark auf, und auch die Herren Miha Sepec und Miha Horvat zeigten ihr Können. Die von ihnen bestrittenen 5 Partien reichten dem BSC zum 5:3 Sieg.

Bundesliga</em></a> (Erstinstanzurteil nicht beachtet)</p><p><strong><em>2. Bundesliga</em></strong><br>Das anstrengende Wochenende mit der Doppelrunde im Osten verlief für den <strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong> speziell gegen Wien glücklos. Es war ein Spiel auf Augenhöhe, das die Vorchdorfer gegen die Wiener in Topbesetzung absolvierten. Wie ausgeglichen die Begegnung war, zeigt allein die Tatsache, dass 11 Sätze auf 2 Punkte Unterschied entschieden wurden. Trotz aufopfernden Kampf reichte es letztlich nicht ganz – mit 5:3 konnten sich die Hauptstädter für die Hinspielniederlage revanchieren. Die Punkte erzielten Manuel Weber / Thomas Wimmer, Zita Banhegyi / Brigitta Rienössl und Dominik Kronsteiner. Das zweite Spiel des Wochenendes am Sonntag gegen den überlegenen Tabellenersten Mödling verlief erwartungsgemäß (1:7). Zita Banhegyi / Dominik Kronsteiner siegten im Mixed und konnten damit den Mödlingern das erst 4. Spiel in der 8. Runde abnehmen.<br>Tags zuvor spielte Mödling gegen den <strong>BSC 70 Linz II</strong>. Auch dieses Spiel verlief gemäß den Erwartungen mit 0:8 gegen die Linzer. Natalie Hofinger und Nina Almer waren mit 21:23 im ersten Satz ihres Doppels knapp am „Ehrensatz“ dran. Ingesamt konnte der BSC nur etwa 1/4 der Punkte für sich entscheiden (137:338). Am Sonnatg spielte die 2er des BSC gegen den BC Feldkirch. Doppelstark zeigten sich die Herren und bezwangen die Vorarlberger in engen Partien. Nina Almer holte den dritten Zähler. Mehr war leider nicht drinnen, der BC Feldkirch siegt mit 5:3 und der BSC 70 Linz II verbleibt auf dem letzten Tabellenplatz.<br>Einen heißen Fight um Platz 2 in der 2. Bundesliga lieferten sich der <strong>BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven</strong> und der BC Feldkirch am Samstag. Die Doppelstärke von Simon Rebhandl zeigte sich im 1. Herreneinzel mit Thomas Hahn und im Mixed mit Iris Freimüller, diese beiden Partien waren nach Punkten (21:13 21:13 bzw. 21:14 21:14) die deutlichsten Siege. Thomas Hahn und Christoph Lessl sorgten für Zweisatzsiege in den Herreneinzeln, Maria Fröhlich und Iris Freimüller machten mit einem 22:20 im dritten Satz des Damendoppels den Sack zu. Alkoven bleibt auf Platz 2 – für das Aufstiegs-Play-Off ist eine Niederlage gegen Mödling in der nächsten Runde erlaubt, danach darf man in der letzten Runde gegen Vorchdorf aber nicht mehr patzen.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 2.

Bundesliga</em></strong><br>Für <strong>Wolfurt</strong> sollten nach dem Urteil in erster Instanz alle Spielergebnisse, bei denen der Engländer Toby Penty teilnahm (der unzulässigerweise auch in einer englischen Liga antrat), nachträglich auf 0:8 gesetzt werden. Nachdem Wolfurt hier eine Selbstanzeige eingebracht hat, ist es wenig überraschend, dass gegen das relativ harte Urteil Berufung eingelegt wurde (siehe <a href=\"http://www.badminton.at/cont/extended.php?id=3496\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bericht</em></a> auf der ÖBV-Homepage). Daher wird sich nun das Schiedsgericht mit dem Fall beschäftigen.<br>Relativ unabhängig von der Debatte ist der <strong>BSC 70 Linz</strong> auf bestem Wege ins Meister-Play-Off, denn je nach Urteil befindet sich der BSC auf dem 3. oder 4. Platz der Tabelle. In der Doppelrunde geht es erst am Sa 26.1. (16:30 Solarcity) gegen den ASV Pressbaum, den man schon im Hinspiel mit 6:2 besiegen konnte. Am So 27.1. (14:00 Solarcity) empfangen die Linzer dann den ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten, der in der Tabelle voranliegt und dem man sich auch im Hinspiel mit 3:5 geschlagen geben musste. Daher ist es für BSC-Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger das erklärte Ziel , dass gegen Pressbaum ein Sieg her muss. Kann man gegen Kärnten noch ein Unentschieden holen, so scheint der Platz im Meister-Play-Off endgültig fix.<br>Für den <strong>ASKÖ Traun</strong> wird es allmählich knapp. Nachdem auch gegen den BSC in der ersten Begegnung der Rückrunde kein Sieg drinnen war, warten auch in der Doppelrunde an diesem Wochenende zwei große Brocken: Am Sa 26.1. (17:30 HAKA Arena Traun) empfängt man den (gemäß bisherigen ÖBV-Urteil) Ranglistenzweiten ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten, tags darauf (27.1. 15:00 HAKA Arena Traun) den erstplatzierten WBH Wien I. Eine Chance für die Trauner ist, dass die Wiener nach dem Fight um Platz 1 gegen Wolfurt am Vortag konditionell geschwächt antreten könnten.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 1. Bundesliga</em></a> (Erstinstanzurteil nicht beachtet)</p><p><strong><em>2. Bundesliga</em></strong><br>Der <strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong> ist der einzige „reisende“ oö. Verein in dieser Doppelrunde, d.h. er ist der einzige mit Auswärtsspielen. So geht es am Sa ostwärts Richtung Wien, wo mit dem WBH II der direkte Konkurrent um den 4. Tabellenplatz wartet. „Zuhause treten die Wiener meist in einer viel stärkeren Formation an,“ wäre UBC-Obmann Harald Starl mit einem Unentschieden zufrieden. „Damit würden wir in der Tabelle auch vor den Hauptstädtern bleiben.“ Weniger Chancen rechnen sich die Vorchdorfer dann am So in der Begegnung mit den in der 2. Liga so dominanten Mödlingern aus. Die Reihung der beiden Spiele kommt den Vorchdorfern jedenfalls sicher zugute.<br>Das gleiche erwartete Ergebnis gilt für den Tabellenletzten <strong>BSC 70 Linz II</strong>, die am Sa 26.1. (12:00 Solarcity) auf den AS Mödling treffen. Vielleicht spart man sich die Kraft für So 27.1., wo um 09:30 in der Solarcity die Gegner aus Feldkirch empfangen werden.<br>Für das Team des <strong>BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven</strong> geht es am Sa 26.1. um 15:00 (TH NMS Alkoven) erst einmal um die Verteidigung des zweiten Tabellenplatzes: Sollten die Feldkircher gewinnen, so könnten die Vorarlberger zumindest punktemäßig gleichziehen. Am zweiten Tag der Doppelrunde erwartet die Alkovener mit WBH Wien II ein schlagbarer Gegner (27.1. 10:00 TH NMS Alkoven). Auch den Alkovenern kann die Reihung der beiden Spiele zugutekommen.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 2.

Wir haben gegen die Malayen aber schon einmal knapp in 3 Sätzen gewonnen.

Für den BSC 70 Linz I ist es nach der Saison 2009/2010 die erste Teilnahme am Halbfinale. Davor hatte der BSC fünf Halbfinalteilnahmen in Folge zu verzeichnen. Nach dem damals nicht erreichten Ziel des Mannschaftmeistertitels (man verlor im Halbfinale im dritten Spiel ganz unglücklich) wurde die Mannschaft komplett umgestellt und die Ausrichtung im Verein völlig neu gestaltet. Dass dieser Weg vorerst der Richtige ist, beweist für Reinhard Hechenberger die heurige Teilnahme am Meister-Playoff. Auch, weil das Ziel in dieser Saison – aufgrund der noch immer im Umbruch befindlichen Strukturen im Verein – eigentlich nur der Verbleib in der 1. Liga war. Dass darüber hinaus in der 2. Bundesliga eine eigene, junge Mannschaft gestellt wird, freut Hechenberger umso mehr.<br>Im Halbfinale muss laut Hechenberger alles stimmen; die Einstellung, Form und der Teamzusammenhalt werden notwendig sein um schlussendlich gewinnen zu können. Aus Sicht des BSC ist der WBH Wien I der Favorit; auch wenn sich der BSC durchaus Chancen ausrechnet (das Spiel der letzten Runde ging mit 5:3 an den WBH). Das erste Spiel findet am <strong>Sa 6.4. 15:00 in der Solarcity </strong>statt. Die Revanche folgt eine Woche darauf am 13.4. in Wien. Ist ein Entscheidungsspiel notwendig, wird es gleich am 14.4. in Wien ausgespielt.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=5\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Mittleres Playoff</strong></em></a><br>Jeder gegen jeden spielen die beiden Letztplatzierten der 1. Bundesliga Pressbaum und ASKÖ Traun sowie die beiden Erstplatzierten der 2. Bundesliga Mödling und BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven. Gleich am ersten Spieltag, am <strong>Sa 6.4. 15:00 in der NMS Alkoven</strong>, findet das OÖ-Derby des mittleren Playoffs statt.<br>Der BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven freut sich über die Teilnahme am Aufstiegs-Playoff. Im Heimspiel gegen Traun wird Alkoven alles daran setzen, den anwesenden Zuschauern spannende Spiele zu bieten. Mannschaftführerin Iris Freimüller sieht der schwierigen Aufgabe gelassen entgegen: „Wir gehen ohne Druck in die Spiele und freuen uns darauf. Wir haben das Saisonziel erreicht, ein Aufstieg wäre eine Sensation. Vielleicht können wir mit guten Leistungen unsere Gegner fordern und ärgern.“<br>Gleich am darauffolgenden Sonntag 7.4. spielen beide oö. Vereine auswärts: Pressbaum empfängt Alkoven und Mödling das Team vom ASKÖ Traun. Die Entscheidungsspiele der Gruppe finden am 1. Mai statt.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=6\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Abstiegs- Playoff</strong></em></a><br>Auf Seiten des BSC 70 Linz II konnte man die eigenen Erwartungen im Grunddurchgang nicht ganz erfüllen. Einerseits zeigten sich während der Saison zu große Leistungsschwankungen, andererseits konnte der BSC II durch Verletzungen und internationale Turnierteilnahmen einiger Nachwuchsspieler praktisch nie komplett antreten.<br>Natürlich wird man im Spiel gegen WBH Wien II am 6.4. versuchen, das Beste zu geben. Der BSC 70 Linz möchte auch in der kommenden Saison in der 2. Bundesliga antreten und den eingeschlagenen Weg weiterführen. Der BSC II will unbedingt vermeiden als Letzter gegen einen potentiellen Aufsteiger in die Bundesliga antreten zu müssen. Der BSC befürchtet einerseits, dass man sich nach der ohnehin langen Saison Ende Mai (25./26.5.) noch gegen aufstiegswillige Vereine behaupten muss, anderseits wird die Vorbereitung und Planung für die kommende Saison schwieriger. Für die Spiele im Abstiegs-Play-off stehen nun wieder alle Spieler zur Verfügung und der BSC II kann aus einem breiten Kader schöpfen. Derzeit befindet sich die 2. Mannschaft in einer intensiven Vorbereitung für das Abstiegs-Playoff. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen des Grunddurchgangs rechnet sich der BSC die größten Chancen gegen WBH Wien II und den UBC Vorchdorf aus.<br>Das Ziel, die Liga zu halten, verfolgt sicherlich auch der UBC Vorchdorf. Zum Auftakt muss der UBC den weiten Weg nach Feldkirch ins Ländle antreten. Beide Spiele des Hauptdurchgangs endeten 3:5. Das OÖ-Derby gegen den BSC 70 Linz II bestreitet der UBC Vorchdorf ebenfalls auswärts am <strong>Sa 13.4. 11:00 in der Solarcity </strong>.</p><p>Bericht: Simon Moser</p><p>Quellen: BSC, Alkoven</p>","2013-03-31","/content/news/Bundesliga-Playoffs-BSC-spielt-um-Meistertitel-in-der-1-Liga/5b9916550c005.png","3");

Das Play-Off um den österreichischen Meister, das mittlere und das Abstiegs-Play-Off sind somit fixiert. In allen Play-Offs sind oö. Vereine vertreten. Die ersten Spiele finden Anfang April statt.</p><p><strong>1. Bundesliga</strong><br>Gegen WBH Wien I hatte der BSC 70 Linz I gestern einen kleine Sensation am Schläger; nach den Doppelspielen hätte man, wenn das 2. Doppel (Jamnik/Baumgartner) nicht im 3. Satz mit 22:20 verloren hätte, mit 3:0 führen können. So musste man mit 2:1 in die schwierigen Einzelspiele gehen. Vor den abschließenden beiden Spielen, dem 3. Einzel und Mixed Doppel stand es 3:3. Im Mixed konnte der BSC an diesem Tag nicht dagegen halten und war folglich 3:4 hinten als Flo Baumgartner in einem packenden Spiel noch um das Unentschieden kämpfte. Schlussendlich musste er sich hauchdünn gegen Vilson Vattanirappel, wiederum mit 20:22, geschlagen geben und Wien I gewann mit 5:3.</p><p>Für den BSC 70 Linz I läuft es derzeit nach Wunsch – die Teilnahme am Halbfinale des Meister-Play-Offs ist fixiert. Seit Montag 4. März ist die finale (verbandsintern nicht anfechtbare) Rechtsentscheidung des ÖBV-Schiedsgerichts online (<a href=\"http://www.badminton.at/files/Schiedsgerichtsurteil2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Urteil</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.badminton.at/cont/extended.php?id=3537\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Artikel ÖBV-Homepage</em></a>). Die Aufhebung des Erstinstanzurteils gegen Wolfurt bedeutet, dass der BSC den 4. Platz des Grunddurchganges erreicht hat und im Semifinale gegen WBH Wien I antritt.</p><p>Wolfurt selbst kann in der letzten Begegnung alle Punkte nach Hause holen, denn der ASKÖ Traun ist im Ländle nicht angetreten. Traun spielt im mittleren Play-Off um den Erhalt der 1. Bundesliga.</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tabelle 1. Bundesliga</em></a></p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga </strong></p><p>Drei Spiele gingen über drei Sätze, dennoch erwies sich der BSC 70 Linz II gegen WBH Wien II als chancenlos, auch weil die Nachwuchshoffnungen Serov und Walchshofer nicht spielten, da sie die Landesmeisterschaften bestritten. Der BSC II steigt damit als klarer Tabellenletzter ins Abstiegs-Play-Off ein.</p><p>Nach Punkten relativ deutlich, aber doch nur einen Platz davor liegt das Team des UBC Vorchdorf. Im OÖ-Derby der Runde unterlagen die Vorchdorfer dem Vizemeister der 2. Bundesliga BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven mit 3:5. Vier Ausfälle verzeichneten die Vorchdorfer bei den Damen – somit lag die ganze Last bei den Herren. Dominik Kronsteiner / Thomas Petzold sorgten für einen klaren Doppelsieg, ehe Thomas Wimmer mit einem hart umkämpften Dreisatzsieg einen wichtigen Punkt holte. Souverän auch Dominik Kronsteiner mit dem Sieg im 3. Einzel. Günter Kofler konnte sich immer besser ins Spiel hineinkämpfen, letztlich musste er sich im Topeinzel knapp in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben.</p><p>Alkoven hat es geschafft und tritt im mittleren, also dem Aufstiegs-Play-Off an.

Die Damen Sarina Kohlfürst und Nika Koncut müssen sich im Doppel nach 2 knappen Sätzen im dritten Satz klar geschlagen geben. Die anderen Spiele verlaufen sehr deutlich gegen den BSC I, der mit seiner ersten Halbfinalteilnahme seit 2010 nun die Saison beendet. Der WBH Wien I trifft nun im Finale auf den Union Badmintonsportclub Wolfurt, der sich in den Best-of-Three-Halbfinali mit 2x 5:2 gegen ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten durchsetzte.</p><p>Wahrscheinlich nicht beendet ist die Saison dagegen für das Bundesliga-Team aus Vorchdorf. Im direkten Abstiegsduell gegen die 2. Mannschaft des BSC am Samstag, dem 13. April in der Solarcity unterliegen die Vorchdorfer 3:5. Wieder wird die markante Doppelschwäche der Herren den Vorchdorfern zum Verhängnis: Harald Hochgatterer mit Andrej Serov und BSC-Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger mit Daniel Walchshofer setzen sich in jeweils zwei Sätzen durch. Die Punkte für den UBC Vorchdorf gelingen sowohl im Damendoppel Zita Banhegyi / Brigitta Riernössl sowie in den Herreneinzeln von Günter Kofler und Vorchdorfs Bank im Einzel, Dominik Kronsteiner.<br>Die letzten Spiele des Abstiegs-Playoffs finden am Mittwoch, dem 1. Mai statt. Der BSC II tritt im Ländle gegen den BC Feldkirch an, der UBC Vorchdorf auswärts gegen den WBH Wien II. Das Rennen gegen den Abstieg bleibt für beide Teams spannend: Gewinnt der UBC Vorchdorf in Wien und verliert der BSC 70 Linz II in Feldkirch, so wäre es doch der BSC II, der sich in Relegationsspielen mit den aufstiegswilligen Vereinen der Landesligen messen müsste. „Jetzt ist der Druck noch viel größer, aber eine Chance ist noch vorhanden“, fasst Vorchdorfs Obmann Starl zusammen. Der BSC II sollte daher gegen den BC Feldkirch gewinnen, bleibt aber am Boden der Tatsachen: „Gewinnt Vorchdorf, würden sie wohl wegen dem besseren Matchverhältnis vor uns bleiben“, weiß Reinhard Hechenberger.</p><p>Am 1. Mai entscheidet sich auch das mittlere Playoff, also das Playoff um den Aufstieg in die 2. Bundesliga bzw. aus dieser herunter. Nachdem für Alkoven bereits vor dem letzten Spiel klar ist, dass ein Aufstieg nicht mehr drinnen ist, gilt es für den ASKÖ Traun, zuhause in der <strong>HAKA Arena Traun um 16:00</strong> gegen den Abstieg zu kämpfen. Nur ein Sieg gegen den direkten niederösterreichischen Abstiegskonkurrenten ASV Pressbaum bedeutet für das Team um Barbara Scheer den sicheren Erhalt der 1. Bundesliga.</p><p>——————————————————-<br>VORSCHAU</p><p>„Alles oder nichts“, heißt es für beide Mannschaften des ASKÖ BSC 70 Linz in der 1. und 2. Bundesliga. Mit einer 2:5 Niederlage ging das 1. Halbfinale in einem 5-Stunden-Krimi im Meister-Play-off an WBH Wien. Auch in Wien rechnet der BSC mit einem engen Spiel voller Emotionen und muss, um Wien in ein 3. Spiel zu zwingen und die Chance auf das Finale aufrecht zu halten, am Sa 13.4. 16:00 gewinnen. Dann würde am 14.4. gleich in Wien die Entscheidung anstehen. „Mit einer ähnlich guten Leistung und mit Glück des Tüchtigen ist noch alles drinnen“, so Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger.<br><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=3\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Meister-Playoff</strong></em></a></p><p>In der 2. Bundesliga geht es für den BSC II, aber auch für die Konkurrenz aus Vorchdorf um den Verbleib in der 2. Bundesliga. Das OÖ-Derby findet am <strong>Sa 13.4. um 11:00 in der Solarcity</strong> statt. In den bisherigen Saisonduellen gab es ein Unentschieden und einen knappen UBC-Sieg. Durch die Ausgeglichenheit der beiden Mannschaften ist ein knappes Resultat zu erwarten. „Mit einem Sieg wären wir praktisch durch“, hofft UBC Vorchdorf-Obmann Harald Starl auf eine Vorentscheidung im Kampf um den Klassenerhalt in der Bundesliga. Nach den zuletzt gezeigten Leistungen gegen Feldkirch müssen sich die Vorchdorfer vor allem in den Doppelspielen steigern. „Da ist noch genug Luft nach oben“, so Starl. Der BSC II muss unbedingt gegen Vorchdorf gewinnen. Ein Unentschieden wäre schon zu wenig um ein drohendes Relegationsspiel gegen potentielle Aufsteiger in die Bundesliga zu vermeiden. Das Team des BSC II hat gut trainiert, muss aber die Nr. 1 der Mannschaft, Alexander Serov, durch Verletzung vorgeben. „Wir werden mit der jungen Mannschaft alles daran setzen gegen Vorchdorf im OÖ. Derby zu gewinnen“, motiviert Mannschaftführer Christoph Kainrath seine Spieler vor dem wichtigen Spiel.<br><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=45AEC7E8-BC55-4738-9FA0-98FDA3D4DBF3&draw=6\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Abstiegs- Playoff</strong></em></a></p><p>Im mittleren Playoff, das aus oö.

Dieser Abstand entspricht dem Abstand der Aufschlaglinien auf einem Tennisspielfeld, die 5,5 m entsprechen der halben Breite eines Tennisplatzes. Durch auflegbare Gummilinien kann daher jeder Tennisplatz einfach in einen Speed-Badminton-Court verwandelt werden. Hierbei wird mit einem sog. Match Speeder gespielt. Bei den Jugendlichen (bis 14 Jahre) wird auf 8,80 m Abstand gespielt und dies mit dem sog. Fun Speeder. Beide Spielvarianten werden ohne Netz gespielt.</p><p><strong>Spielsatz </strong></p><p>Ein Spielsatz endet mit 16 Gewinnpunkten. Bei 15:15 geht der Satz in die Verlängerung, wobei zum Sieg zwei Punkte Vorsprung nötig sind. Ein Match geht grundsätzlich über drei Gewinnsätze. Bei Turnieren kann der jeweilige Veranstalter bis zum Halbfinale auch Spiele mit lediglich zwei Gewinnsätzen gestatten.</p><p><strong>Aufschlag </strong></p><p>Das Recht des ersten Aufschlags und die Wahl der Seite wird in der Regel durch das Werfen einer Münze entschieden (hierfür kann auch der Speeder benutzt werden, indem er in die Luft geworfen wird und derjenige das Wahlrecht erhält, zu dem die Spitze des Speeders näher liegt). Aufgeschlagen wird im Block mit drei Aufschlägen pro Spieler. Jeder gespielte Ballwechsel punktet. Beim Gleichstand von 15:15 wechselt das Aufschlagsrecht nach jedem Punkt. Der Aufschlag erfolgt in einem gedachten Aufschlagrechteck, das über die gesamte Breite des Courts geht und 3 m hinter der vorderen, sogenannten Angriffslinie beginnt. Hierbei ist die Position in dem Aufschlagfeld egal. Die Aufschlagsline darf mit keinem Teil der Füße überquert werden. Der Aufschlag muss von unten ausgeführt werden. Die genaue Regel heißt hier: Im Moment des Treffpunktes muss der Speeder unter der schlägerführenden Hand geschlagen werden. Den ersten Aufschlag des nächsten Satzes hat derjenige, der im vorherigen Satz verloren hat.</p><p><strong>Punktgewinn </strong></p><p>Jeder Ballwechsel wird gezählt, sofern er nicht wiederholt werden muss. Gepunktet wird, wenn</p><ul><li>kein vorschriftsmäßiger Aufschlag gelingt,</li><li>der Speeder den Boden oder die Decke  berührt,</li><li>der Speeder im Spielfeld landet und      nicht retourniert werden kann, wobei die Linien zum Spielfeld gerechnet      werden,</li><li>der Speeder im „Aus“ landet,</li><li>der Speeder zweimal hintereinander  geschlagen wird,</li><li>der Speeder den Körper berührt.</li></ul><p>Wird ein Speeder außerhalb des Spielfeldes weitergespielt, gilt er als angenommen.</p><p><strong>Seitenwechsel </strong></p><p>Nach jedem Satz wird die Seite gewechselt, um die Chancengleichheit hinsichtlich Wind- und Lichtverhältnissen zu gewährleisten. Sollte es zu einem Entscheidungssatz kommen, werden die Seiten nach jeweils sechs gespielten Punkten gewechselt.</p><p> </p>","2013-05-29","/content/news/2-Linzer-Speedmintonturnier-ndash-2262013-ndash-LinzUrfahr/5b9961c73ebc1.png","4");

Drei Mannschaften fanden bei schönstem Frühsommerwetter den Weg in den neu renovierten Turnsaal der HS-Grünburg.</p><p>War am Beginn der Veranstaltung den 8-14-jährigen Jungsportlern noch die Aufregung ins Gesicht geschrieben, entwickelte sich bald ein rasantes und kampfbetontes Spielgeschehen. Ehrgeiz, Einsatz und Motivation standen keineswegs den Erwachsenen nach. Im Gegenteil: da wurde um jeden Punkt gekämpft, gelaufen, gerackert. Diskussionen mit den Schiedsrichtern um jeden Zentimeter lösten sich ab mit der Freude über jeden gelungenen Ballwechsel. Die Emotionen waren so stark, dass am Ende einiger Spiele Tränen genauso an der Tagesordnung standen wie ungestüme Freudentänze.</p><p>Nach den 18 gespielten Partien ging die HS-Grünburg hauchdünn als Sieger vom Platz. Zweiter wurde die Mannschaft des ATSV Steinbach-Grünburg und dritter die Schüler des TUS Kremsmünster. Für die Organisatoren und Trainer setzte sich die Erkenntnis durch, dass ein „Wettkampf auf Augenhöhe“ die Kinder und Jugendlichen motiviert und beflügelt. Auch das Prinzip Fairness wurde symbolisch dokumentiert, indem alle Mannschaften gleich große Pokale und sämtliche Teilnehmer eine Urkunde überreicht bekamen. Im Herbst soll in Kremsmünster die Fortsetzung folgen.</p><p>Text und Foto: Raimund Ločičnik</p>","2013-05-01","/content/news/Schueler-Badmintonturnier-begeisterte-Trainer-und-Eltern/5b9965c562ba3.png","5");

UBC Vorchdorf schaffte quasi „5 vor 12“ durch einen Sieg gegen WBH Wien im letzten Spiel der Play-off doch noch den Klassenerhalt in der Badminton Bundesliga. Vor dem entscheidenden Spiel gegen Wien war die Ausgangslage klar: Vorchdorf braucht einen Sieg – und Linz darf in Feldkirch nicht gewinnen.<br> Erstmals in dieser Saison konnten die Vorchdorfer komplett antreten – Miriam Gruber feierte nach ihrer „Babypause“ ein Comeback und gab der Mannschaft zusätzlich Rückhalt. Von Beginn an merkte man den Heimischen die Nervosität an und Manuel Weber / Thomas Wimmer mussten sich knapp in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben. Etwas Ruhe kehrte durch den klaren Doppelsieg von Dominik Konsteiner / Günter Kofler ein. Im Damendoppel wurden nochmals die Nerven aller stark strapaziert, ehe sich Zita Banhegyi / Brigitta Riernössl in drei knappen Sätzen durchsetzen konnten. Günter Kofler erhöhte durch seinen klaren Sieg gegen den Finnen Pykönnen auf 3 : 1. Obwohl sich Thomas Wimmer gegen den Deutschen Hinz in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben musste, konnten Dominik Kronsteiner und Zita Banhegyi mit ihren klaren Siegen auf 5 : 2 stellen. Das abschließende Mixed verloren zwar Manuel Weber / Miriam Gruber in drei Sätzen – mit dem 5 : 3 Endstand fixierte das UBC-Team den ersehnten Klassenerhalt.<br> „Ein Lob an die gesamte Mannschaft – der Druck auf das Team war heute enorm und wir haben letztlich verdient gewonnen. Zudem gingen alle verlorenen Partien erst im Entscheidungssatz verloren“, zeigte sich UBC-Obmann Harald Starl rundum zufrieden. In der nächsten Saison feiert UBC Vorchdorf 20 Jahre Bundesliga. „Daher war der Sieg heute umso bedeutender.“</em></p><p>Die <strong>Gerüchteküche</strong> um die nächste Saison brodelt. Es könnte mit Ohlsdorf nur eine aufstiegswillige Mannschaft in Österreich geben. Stellt eine Mannschaft den Bundesligabetrieb ein, und auch das könnte eine oberösterreichische sein, so wird es keinen Abstiegskampf geben.</p><p>Bericht: Simon Moser</p>","2013-05-01","/content/news/Traun-steigt-ab-Vorchdorf-sichert-Liga/5b9965f9ae088.png","9");

Landesliga oder der Bezirksliga unvollständig antreten, nicht mehr die volle Punktezahl erhalten. D.h. wenn in einer Meisterschaftsbegegnung nicht mit zumindest 4 Herren und zumindest 2 Damen angetreten wird, verringern sich die Tabellenpunkte für einen Sieg von 3 auf 2, für ein Unentschieden von 2 auf 1, für eine Niederlage von 1 auf 0. Treten beide Mannschaften unvollständig an, müssen beide eine Punktereduktion hinnehmen.<br><em>Begründung</em>: Allgemeine Diskussion und Abstimmung anlässlich der Saisonabschlussbesprechung. Das taktische Vorgehen einiger Vereine, trotz verfügbarer zweiter Dame bzw. viertem Herren das Spiel w.o. zu geben, um andere Spiele abzusichern, scheint Auslöser dieser Diskussion gewesen zu sein. (Z.B. lasse gute Dame das Mixed und Einzel spielen und gebe Doppel w.o., anstatt zu riskieren, dass mit der weniger guten Dame das Doppel und ein weiteres Spiel verloren gehen.)</p><p><strong>Mitarbeiter/in im Nachwuchsreferat</strong><br>Der OÖBV sieht das Nachwuchsreferat als ein essenzielles Referat an, das entscheidend die Zukunft des Verbandes mitbeeinflusst bzw. mibeeinflussen soll. Insbesondere nach dem Rückzug von Markus Benda kann dieses Referat aus Personalgründen nicht Arbeit in dem Ausmaß leisten, das wünschenswert wäre. Der OÖBV sucht daher nach Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern in diesem Referat.</p><p><strong>Infos von der ÖBV-Sitzung</strong><br>Auf der <strong>ÖBV</strong>-Sitzung wurde eine Erhöhung der Nenngelder für ÖBV-Turniere (z.B. C-/D-Turniere) diskutiert – diese wurde abgelehnt.<br>Die <strong>D-Turniere</strong> wurden zuletzt samstags ausgetragen. Anscheinend wird seitens des ÖBV überlegt, die D-Turniere der kommenden Saison auf Sonntag zu verlegen.<br>Der Veranstalter eines C-Turniers der Region OÖ/SBG ist noch offen. Bewerbungen gehen an den ÖBV.</p><p><strong>KORREKTUR</strong>: Nach der Diskussion, ob der Letztplatzierte der 2. Bundesliga sicher absteigen müsse und nicht mehr am Aufstiegsturnier teilnehmen dürfe, wurde diese Änderung NICHT beschlossen. D.h. der Letztplatzierte kann weiterhin am Abstiegsturnier teilnehmen und im Fall des Sieges in der Bundesliga verbleiben.</p><p>Eure begründete Meinung bzw. konstruktive Kritik gerne an Simon Moser unter news@badminton-ooe.at.</p>","2013-07-03","/content/news/Aktuelle-Infos-von-der-Juli-Vorstandssitzung-des-OOEBV-korrigiert/5b996dc60c5a8.png","6");

Nach den Erfahrungen der letzten Jahre, bei denen die Aufsteiger meist zu den designierten Absteigern wurden, ist das durchaus erstaunlich und man darf gespannt sein, wer sich die Halbzeitführung in der 1. Landesliga erkämpft.<br>Noch viel spannender und vor allem ausgeglichener sieht es in der 1. Klasse Süd aus. Hier halten alle Mannschaften nach 3 Runden bei 6 Punkten.<br>Lediglich Altmünster hat durch eine Strafwertung einen Punkt weniger. In dieser Klasse scheint jeder jeden schlagen zu können.

Meisterschaftsrunde zurück. In der 1. Landesliga führt auch nach der 2. Runde noch immer der Aufsteiger aus Kirchdorf. Auch der BSC Linz konnte Kirchdorf nicht besiegen, sondern musste sich, wenn auch sehr knapp den Spielerinnen und Spielern von Kirchdorf geschlagen geben. Alle übrigen Mannschaften der 1. Landesliga mussten bereits Punkte abgeben.<br>Immer wieder taucht noch immer die Frage auf, ob eine Mannschaft eines Vereins, die in einer höheren Liga spielt mit SpielerInnen einer Mannschaft, die weiter unten spielt aufgefüllt werden muss. Diese Regel gibt es nicht.<br>Einzige Ausnahme: Ein Verein spielt mit insgesamt 5 Mannschaften in der OÖMM. Es ist zum Beispiel nicht möglich mit der 3. Mannschaft ständig nicht anzutreten und mit der 4. bis 5. Mannschaft weiterhin vollständig anzutreten. Das käme der Auflösung der 3. Mannschaft gleich und das ist laut Reglement nur mit der untersten Mannschaft eines Vereins möglich. Hier wäre auf Dauer ein Auffüllen mit SpielerInnen der unteren Mannschaften erforderlich.<br>In den unteren Klassen und Ligen gibt es weiterhin recht spannende Begegnungen, die mich auch zeitweise sehr überraschen. So fällt auch ein Ergebnis auf, dass strafverifiziert wurde. Es kam zu einer Begegnung, bei der der Heimverein keine Dame hatte, was nach wie vor nicht erlaubt ist.<br>Es gab auch einige Strafverifikationen, wo eine Mannschaft nicht antreten konnte. Wenn ich selber als Mannschaftsführer der 4. Mannschaft des BSC 70 Linz oder auch als Schiedsrichter in der 1. und 2. Bundesliga unterwegs bin, fällt mir auch immer wieder auf, dass offenbar viele SpielerInnen die Regeln nicht kennen und daher einige Verwirrung entsteht. Und das gibt es auch in der höchsten Spielklasse in Österreich nicht zu selten. Da es aber in der OÖMM keine Schiedsrichter gibt, wird so mancher Ballwechsel wohl nicht wiederholt, obwohl es im Regelwerk einer Wiederholung bedarf. Ich bin aber schon gespannt, was die 3. Runde alles mit sich bringt. </p><p>… bis nach Runde 3.</p>","2013-10-28","/content/news/hellip-von-Klaus-Mitterhauser-nach-Runde-2/5b9a9f902e3ee.png","5");

Die erste Runde in dieser Saison ist nun bereits gespielt und es fallen vor allem 2 Dinge sofort auf. Die Ergebnisse im Ergebnisdienst wurden doch diese Saison in der ersten Runde zeitnah zu den Spielen eingetragen, wobei ich mir durchaus vorstellen kann, dass dies noch zeitnaher geschehen könnte, aber bitte, diese Saison liegen zumindest alle in der Toleranz von 2 Werktagen, was in den letzten Jahren auch nicht immer der Fall war.<br>Mit dem Bestätigen sind aber doch einige Vereine noch immer sehr nachlässig.<br>Auch dies wäre wirklich wünschenswert. Was auch noch auffällt, ist die Tatsache, dass der eine oder andere Verein noch immer einen unbekannten Spieler / eine unbekannte Spielerin im Detailergebnis „einträgt“, was ein wenig am Ziel vorbei geht. Dank unserem Sekretariat geht ja selbst eine SpielerInnen Nachnennung fast schon innerhalb von wenigen Stunden, sodass eigentlich immer der / diejenige SpielerIn auch wirklich im System vorhanden sein müsste. Übrigens ja auch die Voraussetzung für den Einsatz eines Spielers / einer Spielerin.<br>Auch ein wenig zu fruchten scheint die Tatsache, dass das Ligagremium doch schon ein paar Jahre aktiv arbeitet, so wurden heuer weniger Aufstellungen beanstandet. Leider ist aber auch das Auge des Ligagremiums nicht vor kleinen Fehlern gefeit und so kann es durchaus notwendig sein, dass ein Vereinsverantwortlicher einen Hinweis zeitgerecht dem Verbandssekretariat mitteilt, damit solche Ungereimtheiten in Aufstellungen noch weniger werden.</p><p>Und noch etwas scheint ganz gut zu greifen. Die neue Punktregelung in der 2.<br>LL und in der Bezirksliga, wo Antrittspunkte nur für vollständige Mannschaften zu bekommen sind. Das bringt durchaus einige Veränderungen in den Tabellen. Ich denke, dass diese Regelung auf Dauer dazu führen wird, dass dem Taktieren mit einer nicht vollständigen Mannschaft damit ein Ende gesetzt wird.<br>Wirklich überraschende Ergebnisse brachte die erste Runde nicht hervor. In der ersten Runde der ersten Landesliga ist nur etwas überraschend der Aufsteiger Union Kirchdorf 1 der erste Tabellenführer. Damit stehen erstmals die beiden Aufsteiger aus der 2. LL auf den beiden ersten Plätzen. Dies wird sich aber im Laufe der Saison doch noch etwas ausgleichen. Aber es könnte durchaus spannend werden, wie sich die Saison weiter entwickelt.<br>Bis nach Runde 2 … </p><p>Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2013-10-08","/content/news/hellip-Klaus-Mitterhauser/5b9aa2e374b09.png","4");

Bundesliga</strong><br>Für die 2. Mannschaft wird es kommendes Wochenende wieder spannend. Nach dem Ligaerhalt im Turnier gegen potenzielle Aufsteiger geht es für den BSC 70 Linz mit einer 2. Mannschaft in der Bundesliga weiter. „Wir wollen vieles besser machen und vor allem nicht mehr am Aufstiegsturnier teilnehmen müssen“, kommentiert Mannschaftsführer Christoph Kainrath die Situation vor der Saison. „Aus Vereinssicht ist eine Teilnahme mit 2 Mannschaften in der Bundesliga eine große Herausforderung. Wir werden die Saison mit einem Mix aus Jung und Alt absolvieren. Wenn alle fit sind und wir mit dem bestmöglichem Team antreten können, können wir auf jeden Fall ein unangenehmer Gegner sein.“ Gegen Feldkirch wird es zu Beginn gleich ganz schwer – ein ausgeglichenes Match ist zu erwarten, wobei man unter anderem auch aufgrund der Damenstärke von Feldkirch dem Gastgeber die Favoritenrolle überlassen kann.</p><p><strong>1. Bundesliga</strong><br>Es ist wohl das Ziel aller Teams den amtierenden Mannschaftsmeister vom Thron zu stürzen! Der Meister der vergangenen Saison, WBH WIen I, ist, auch mit leicht geänderter Mannschaft, noch immer Favorit. „Unsere 1. Mannschaft geht mit einigen Änderungen in die neue Saison. Mit den Zugängen haben wir neue Möglichkeiten und wir hoffen schnellmöglich zu einer optimalen Aufstellung zu kommen; viel Zeit bleibt uns hier nicht und vor allem in der 1. Runde gegen den Aufsteiger Mödling ist dies gleich der erste Gradmesser.“ kommentiert Mannschaftsführer und Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger den Saisonstart. Die Mödlinger Mannschaft ist unverändert gegenüber der Aufstiegssaison und hatte bereits letzte Saison Erstliganiveau.

Sowohl im Einzel-, als auch im Doppel- und Mixed-Bewerb holte er sich den Sieg und damit die vollen Ranglistenpunkte. Gemeinsam mit seinem Bruder Dominik war der Doppelbewerb eine klare Angelegenheit. Im Mixed-Bewerb traf er mit seiner Vereinskollegin Hannah Mairhofer auf  eine im österreichischen Nachwuchskader stehende Vorarlberger Paarung. Der erste Satz ging klar an die Welser. Der zweite Satz gestaltete sich ausgeglichener, aber auch diesem entschieden Hannah und Luka schlussendlich für sich. Das letzte Spiel des Turnieres war das Einzel gegen den Vorarlberger Nationalkaderspieler Kilian Meusburger. Nach klarem Sieg im ersten Satz unterliefen Luka Leko im zweiten viele Eigenfehler. Angetrieben von rund 60 Vorarlberger Fans in der Halle schaffte der Lokalmatador den Satzausgleich. Im entscheidenden dritten Satz fand Luka wieder zu seiner Ruhe und seinem kraftvollen Spiel und gewann diesen ungefährdet.</p><p>Hannah Mairhofer gelang mit ihrer niederösterreichischen Partnerin der dritte Rang im Doppel der Mädchen U15.

So fällt in dieser Runde auf, dass es doch sehr überraschende Ergebnisse in manchen Begegnungen gibt. Das geht sogar so weit, dass die von der Papierform her stärker eingeschätzte Mannschaft gegen einen vermeintlich schwächeren Gegner mit 8:0 nach Hause fährt. In wie weit dieses Ergebnis den Tatsachen entspricht, kann ja niemand nachvollziehen, aber Überraschungen im Badminton gibt es eben doch hin und wieder, selbst in der Bundesliga, wo aber garantiert keine Absprachen passieren.</p><p>Nun zur Bilanz der 4. Runde: In der 1. Landesliga wurde durch einen klaren Sieg vom letztjährigen Mannschaftslandesmeister Ohlsdorf der bisherige Tabellenführer Kirchdorf mit einem Schlag wieder in die Nähe der Abstiegsplätze versetzt. Komisch, dass diesmal gerade die Damen bei Kirchdorf geschwächt antreten mussten, denn gerade im Damenbereich haben sich die Kirchdorfer bisher sehr gut geschlagen. Der Spielbericht zeigt auch, dass das Mixed vor dem Dameneinzel gespielt wurde. Denn nur so kann ein Ergebnis im Mixed zustande kommen. Generell ist das aber möglich, die Spielreihenfolge zu ändern, wenn sich beide Teams darauf einigen, was in den meisten Fällen der Fall sein wird.</p><p>In der 1. Klasse Nord hat sich nun Andorf 2 mit einem knappen Sieg gegen den BSC 70 Linz 4 doch ein wenig vom Rest absetzen können und somit sollte der Halbzeitführende doch bereits vor der 5. Runde feststehen. Wenn Andorf 2 den Titel in der 1. Klasse Nord erkämpft, dann ist das ein glatter Durchmarsch in die Bezirksliga.</p><p>In der 2. Klasse Süd haben sich nach dem extrem knappen Tabellenstand nach Runde 3 nun 3 Mannschaften durch Siege geringfügig abgesetzt. Trotzdem scheint es hier sehr spannend zu bleiben.</p><p>Eine noch erwähnenswerte Tatsache zeigt sich heuer in den 2. Klassen. In der 2. Klasse Nord setzt sich Alkoven 4 schon etwas ab, da der Zweitplatzierte bereits einmal nicht antreten konnte. In der 2. Klasse Süd wird das ganze wohl eine One Mannschaft Show für Union Windischgarsten 2, die bislang alles dominieren. Nun darf man gespannt auf die letzte Herbstrunde schauen. Mal sehen, ob es noch zu Überraschungen kommt, oder sich die Ergebnisse nach der Papierform richten…</p><p>Bis dann.</p><p>Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2013-11-19","/content/news/hellip-von-Klaus-Mitterhauser-nach-Runde-4/5b9aa80410d83.png","4");

Die Sportler liefen gestern erstmal mit den neuen Dressen auf.</p><p>„Mit 3 tollen Spielen in Folge konnte der BSC 70 Linz mit dem Tabellenführer gleichziehen und lauert vor der letzten Runde darauf, vielleicht doch noch den Herbstmeistertitel zu holen.“ Dieser 1. Platz zur Hälfte der Saison wäre schon ein toller Abschluss einer ganz, ganz schlecht gestarteten Saison (mit einer klaren Niederlage gegen den Noch-Erstplatzierten Mödling). „In 3 Wochen wollen wir gegen Askö Kelag Kärnten punkten und wenn Mödling noch einmal Federn lässt ist für uns die Top-Position noch drinnen“, schaut Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger bereits in Richtung 5.

Mannschaft: Askö Traun war auch in dieser Runde zu stark für unser junges Team, das mit einigen Ausfällen zu kämpfen hatte. Da musste auch Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger ran und sorgte wohl für die Überraschung der Begegnung. Der 41-Jährige siegte gegen Klaus Dornig (wurde mit Traun 2011 Meister) in 3 umkämpften Sätzen. „Leider war dieser Sieg nicht genug für das Team“, war Mannschaftsführer Christoph Kainrath etwas traurig. Unser Plan, dadurch Andrej Serov in das 3. Einzel zu bekommen und 2 Einzelspiele zu gewinnen, ging aber voll auf. Mit neuen Trikotsponsor FAW Hagenberg und Ausstattung durch Adidas spielten die Jungen des BSC 70 Linz gut auf und vor allem die Jungen zeigten gute Leistungen. „Es fehlt nur mehr an Kleinigkeiten, hoffentlich können die Spieler das rasch abrufen“, blick Christoph Kainrath bereits in die Zukunft und hofft auf den 1. Punktgewinn der Saison.</p><p>„Dieser Einzelsieg war eine gute Motivation für mich, bei den Senioren Staatsmeisterschaften in Hohenems doch im Einzel auch an den Start zu gehen. Seit der Senioren WM im September konnte ich durch kleinere Verletzungen nicht wirklich trainieren und wollte schon fast meine Teilnahme bei den Meisterschaften absagen“ war Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger aber mit seinem Spiel dennoch zufrieden. „Wenn das Team zumindest ein 4:4 geschafft hätte wäre für mich dieser Sieg noch schöner gewesen – wer weiß, vielleicht kann ich ein anderes Mal der Mannschaft noch einmal helfen.“</p><p>Christoph Kainrath (Mannschaftsführer): „In 3 Wochen versuchen wir in Vorchdorf erneut einen ersten Sieg einzufahren. Dort sollte die Stammmannschaft wieder verfügbar sein.“ Dann aber mit Sicherheit ohne Obmann Hechenberger. Er ist mit der 1. Mannschaft in Klagenfurt.</p><p>Bericht: BSC 70 Linz</p>","2013-11-11","/content/news/3-Sieg-in-Folge-ndash-Pressbaum-konnte-den-Erfolgslauf-von-BSC-70-Linz-1-nicht-stoppen/5b9aa88c9f3ee.png","3");

Hier hat sich der BSC 70 Linz 3 den Herbsttitel geholt, auch wenn ich nach Runde 4 noch auf Ohlsdorf getippt hätte. Eine spannende Rückrunde ist aber damit garantiert, zumal es an der Spitze ziemlich eng zugeht. Lediglich Steyr 1 wird wohl kaum noch in den Titelkampf eingreifen können, allerdings könnten sie eine entscheidende Rolle spielen, wenn sie in der Rückrunde den Titelaspiranten die Punkte streitig machen können.</p><p>In den beiden 2. Landesligen sieht es wie folgt aus: In der 2. LL Nord konnte sich Alkoven 2 einen kleinen Vorsprung auf Urfahr sichern und blieb in der Hinrunde ohne Niederlage. In der 2. LL Süd gibt es mit Neuhofen 1 einen Dominator, der alle Spiele der Hinrunde für sich entscheiden konnte.</p><p>Lediglich Vorchdorf könnte in der Rückrunde mit einem Sieg gegen Neuhofen 1 den Kampf um den 1. Tabellenplatz und damit Meistertitel der 2. LL Süd verhindern. Der Rest scheint schon zu weit abgeschlagen, aber wie hieß es nach der Runde 4? Erstens kommt es anders, zweitens als man denkt.</p><p>In der Bezirksliga heißen die beiden Herbstmeister Alkoven 3 und Steyrermühl. Da hier kein klarer Vorsprung zu erkennen ist, kommt es in diesen Ligen sicher zu einer spannenden Rückrunde.</p><p>In den beiden 1. Klassen stehen mit Andorf 2 in Nord und einem kleinen Fragezeichen Steinbach/Grünburg 1 in Süd an der Tabellenspitze. In der 2. Klasse steht mit Union Windischgarsten in Süd der Favorit auf Platz 1. In Nord ist es wiederum Alkoven mit der 4. Mannschaft, die sich damit die Krone in allen Klassen bzw. Ligen in der OÖMM sichern, in denen sie antreten.</p><p>Nun noch eine kleine Anmerkung in eigener Sache, da so mancher Bericht aus den Ligen geplaudert heftige Reaktionen ausgelöst hat: Die Meinung und der Kommentar in der Rubrik „Aus den Ligen geplaudert …“ stellt meine persönlichen Eindruck aus vielen Jahren der Beobachtung und auch aktiven Beteiligung in den verschiedensten Mannschaften der OÖMM dar. Heuer bin ich wieder im Geschehen als Mannschaftsführer des BSC 70 Linz 4 mit dabei. Im Ligagremium war ich das auch die letzten Jahre. Dieses wird sich vor dem Beginn der Rückrunde auch wieder die Aufstellungen durchsehen und gegebenenfalls einige Korrekturen vornehmen, wie auch schon in den letzten Jahren.</p><p>Und zum Schluss noch allen Leserinnen und Lesern schöne Feiertage und bis auf bald im neuen Jahr …<br>Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2013-12-05","/content/news/mit-Klaus-Mitterhauser-hellip-Halbzeit/5b9aaa17b4751.png","8");

Wiederum war es gegen Kärnten ein tolles Spiel und ein gutes Ergebnis für die Cracks des BSC 70 Linz in der 1. Bundesliga. Mit 7:1 tritt man die Heimreise an. „Das hat sich das Team hart erarbeitet und verdient.“ ist sich Obmann & Mannschaftsführer Reinhard Hechenberger sicher.</p><p>Unser Kader ist ausgeglichen und wir haben noch Reserven, zumal gestern auch wieder kurzfristig Sarina Kohlführt wegen Krankheit absagen und Vladimir Metiotiev noch vor wenigen Tagen im Bett lag. Kek Jamnik stand wegen eines Turniers in Afrika gar nicht im Aufgebot. Unser Selbstvertrauen konnten wir aber mit den letzten Siegen aufbauen und damit geht man leichter ins Spiel.</p><p>Das Spiel war, wie alle andere Begegnungen zuvor, kein Leichtes. Die Spiele waren allesamt knapp, jedoch schaffen es die Linzer zum richtigen Zeitpunkt die entscheidenden Punkte in den Matches und auch die Begegnungen zu gewinnen. Dass es gestern gegen Klagenfurt so klar war, lag auch daran, dass Belinda Heber sich im Damen Einzel (Ende 1. Satz) eine Verletzung zuzog und daraufhin Satz und Spiel abgeben musste und Nika Koncut, die bis dorthin gut spielte, durch w.o. das Spiel gewann. Auch das abschließende Mixed konnte nicht mehr gespielt werden und ging w.o. an Linz. An dieser Stelle wünschen wir Belinda Heber alles Gute und hoffen, dass die Verletzung nicht zu schwer ist.</p><p>In den übrigen Einzel-Spielen ist durchaus eine Leistungssteigerung noch möglich. Peyo hat sich erwartet schwer gegen den für Klagenfurt spielenden Krassimir Yankov getan und unter seinem Wert in 2 Sätzen verloren. Im 2. Einzel hatte Vladmir gegen Dominik Trojan ebenfalls keine leichte Aufgabe. Mit gutem Spiel konnte das Spiel in 2 Sätzen für Linz gewonnen werden. Im 3. Einzel verschlief Miha Sepec wiedermal den Beginn des Matches und kam erst gegen Ende des Satzes ins Spiel. Leider ging dieser trotz hohem Rückstand dann an Michi Trojan. Im weiterem Spielverlauf ließ Miha nichts mehr anbrennen und gewann schlussendlich.</p><p>Mit stolzem Blick auf die Tabelle geht man in die Winterpause und bereitet sich auf die Begegnung gegen Mödling am 11.1.2014 in Linz wieder vor.</p>","2013-12-01","/content/news/1-Bundesliga-BSC-70-Linz-ist-Herbstmeister/5b9aaaa5a2f40.png","6");

Runde melde ich mich zurück. Richtig spannend beginnt die Rückrunde in der 1. Landesliga. Hier ist die Dramatik kaum zu unterbinden. Ohlsdorf 1 übernimmt die Tabellenspitze mit einem Sieg gegen den Herbstmeister BSC 70 Linz. Union Windischgarsten verliert etwas überraschend das Ortsderby und verabsäumt damit den Weg an die Tabellenspitze. Damit geht es aber wirklich knapp in der Tabelle her, denn zwischen Platz 1 und Platz 5 kann noch alles passieren, denn der 1. liegt nur einen Punkt vor den 4 Verfolgern. Lediglich Steyr steht als Fixabsteiger schon fest. Also ist noch sehr viel Spannung angesagt in dieser Liga.<br>In der 2. Landesliga gab es sowohl in Nord und Süd jeweils Favoritensiege.<br>In den Bezirksligen fällt nur eine Überraschung auf, denn Kremsmünster gewinnt gegen den Tabellenzweiten Neuhofen 2, muss allerdings den Antrittspunkt vorgeben.<br>In den 1. Klassen gab es in Süd eine kleine Überraschung, da Altmünster Stadl Paura knapp bezwingen kann. Altmünster scheint sich also aus dem anfänglichen Tief in der Meisterschaft wieder zu erholen. In der 1. Klasse Nord gab es stets Favoritensiege. Lediglich die Wette innerhalb der 4.<br>Mannschaft des BSC 70 Linz, bei der bei einem 8:0 Erfolg der Mannschaftsführer beim letzten Spiel in der Meisterschaft sein Spiel in der Lederhose bestreiten wird, sollte in Erinnerung gehalten werden, denn die Mannschaft ließ es sich nicht nehmen, dieses Ziel auch zu erreichen.<br>In den 2. Klassen gab es auch keine Überraschungen. In Süd dominiert das Team von Union Windischgarsten nach wie vor die Klasse nach Belieben.<br>Schon am 27.1. beginnt die Runde 7.

Heute konnten wir nur das 1. Einzel gewinnen; das zweite und dritte Herren-Einzel sowie das Damen-Einzel gingen verloren. Ein Zustand den wir aus der Hinrunde nicht kennen. Jetzt heißt es hart arbeiten, die Form wieder finden und in 14 Tagen wieder stark präsentieren …“</p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga im oö.

Sieger der Runde ist der ASKÖ Traun, der dem Tabellenführer Feldkirch auf den Fersen bleibt. Vorchdorf siegt zwar zwei Mal, verliert für den Rest der Saison aber den fixen Herreneinzel-Punkt durch Dominik Kronsteiner (siehe unten).</p><p>BSC 70 Linz II – UBC Vorchdorf 1-7<br>BC Schweiger Sport Alkoven – Askö Traun 3-5<br>UBC Vorchdorf – BC Schweiger Sport Alkoven 5-3<br>BSC 70 Linz II – BC Feldkirch 0-8<br>Askö Traun – WBH Wien II 7-1</p><p><strong>Pressebericht Alkoven</strong></p><p><em>Stark geschwächt und ohne Glück in der Doppelrunde</em></p><p>Einige Parallelitäten gab es am Wochenende in den beiden Spielen des Alkovener Badmintonteams. Beide Spiele waren OÖ-Derbys, noch dazu fehlten die Mannschaftsstützen Iris Freimüller und Simon Rebhandl und beide Spiele endeten glücklos 3:5. Auffällig war, dass in beiden Spielen kein einziges Doppel gewonnen wurde, gewöhnlich eine Stärke des Teams. Am Samstag empfingen die Alkovener daheim den oftmaligen Mannschaftsmeister ASKÖ Traun. Die Partie verlief ungemein spannend und die Zuschauer kamen auf ihre Rechnung. Nach starken Leistungen von Thomas Hahn, Lukas Rebhandl und Maria Steinmann stand es sogar 3:3. Leider musste sich das Damendoppel Fröhlich/Steinmann in der Verlängerung des 3.Satzes mit 23:25 geschlagen geben. Auch Christoph Lessl verlor sein Match erst im Entscheidungssatz. Einen ähnlichen Verlauf nahm das Sonntagsspiel in Vorchdorf gegen die dortige Union. Wieder mussten sich die Damen knapp geschlagen geben. Sowohl das Dameneinzel als auch das Damendoppel gingen erst im 3.Satz verloren. Stark spielten die Herren in ihren Einzelspielen. Lukas Rebhandl, Thomas Hahn und Christoph Lessl besiegten ihre Gegner, leider war das aber auch wieder zu wenig. Damit wurden auch die Chancen auf einen Platz im Aufstiegs-Play-Off begraben.</p><p><strong>Pressebericht Vorchdorf</strong></p><p><em>Vorchdorf: Zwei Derbysiege – Kronsteiner verletzt sich bei Matchball </em><br>Der Erfolgslauf der Vorchdorfer Badminton-Asse geht weiter. Mit 7 : 1 feierte das UBC – Team einen klaren Auswärtserfolg im OÖ. Derby gegen Schlusslicht Linz. Und tags darauf gegen Alkoven feierte das Team einen 5 : 3 Heimerfolg über Alkoven.<br>Gegen die Linzer mussten sich lediglich die beiden „Routiniers“ Dominik Kronsteiner / Manuel Weber knapp in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben.<br>Günter Kofler / Lukas Fröhlich und Zita Banhegyi / Katharina Hochmeier führten durch ihre Doppelsiege die Wende herbei. Auch die Einzel waren eine klare Angelegenheit für Vorchdorf: Günter Kofler, Dominik Kronsteiner, Miriam Gruber und Florian Brandstötter siegten jeweils in zwei klaren Sätzen. Für Brandstötter war es bei seinem Einzeldebüt gleich ein Premierensieg. Den Schlusspunkt setzten Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi mit dem Sieg im Mixed. </p><p><em>Kronsteiner riss sich bei Matchball Achillessehne</em><br>Aggressiv und voll „ausgeschlafen“ präsentiere sich das UBC Team bei der Matinee gegen Alkoven. Sowohl Manuel Weber / Thomas Wimmer als auch Dominik Kronsteiner / Günter Kofler boten ihre beste Doppelleistung seit Jahren und konnten so beide Doppel gegen die Spezialisten aus Alkoven gewinnen. Als dann auch noch Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi im Damendoppel das Spiel drehten und in drei Sätzen gewannen, schienen die Zeichen auf einen klaren UBC Sieg zu sein. Durch knappe Einzelniederlagen von Günter Kofler und Thomas Wimmer kamen die Alkovener bis auf 2 : 3 heran. Dominik Kronsteiner dominierte den ersten Satz klar – gewann 21:7 und hatte bei 21:20 Matchball. Doch aus dem Jubel wurde nichts – Kronsteiner riss sich bei einem Sprungsmash die Achillessehne und aus dem „sicheren“ Sieg wurde eine unglückliche Niederlage. 3 : 3 und Vorchdorf stand plötzlich mit dem Rücken zur Wand. </p><p>Doch das UBC-Team zeigte sich kämpferisch. Zuerst siegten Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi sicher im Mixed, ehe Miriam Gruber nach verlorenen ersten Satz ihre alte Stärke fand und die Landesmeisterin Maria Steinmann mit 16:21, 21:15, 21:14 besiegte. Damit gelang den Heimischen die Revanche für die Niederlage im Herbst. Seit diesem Spiel ist UBC Vorchdorf ungeschlagen – gewann zuletzt vier Spiele in Serie und liegt auf dem 3. Platz in der Tabelle.</p><p>„So sehr ich mich über die beiden Siege freue, die Verletzung von Dominik Kronsteiner schmerzt enorm,“ ist für UBC Obmann Harald Starl die Freude über die tolle Serie getrübt. In den beiden letzten Runden muss Vorchdorf noch nach Feldkirch zum Tabellenführer und empfängt zum „Finale“ Traun um den Aufstieg ins Play-off.</p>","2014-01-27","/content/news/Bundesliga-Zuerst-die-guten-oder-die-schlechten-Nachrichten/5b9aba974d29c.png","3");

Wiederum tat man sich gegen die Mödlinger schwer – zumindest konnte man diesmal ein Unentschieden einfahren (zum Auftakt der Saison verlor man 2:6). Trotz zwischenzeitlicher 3:1-Führung kämpfte sich Mödling zurück ins Match und führte vor dem letzten Spiel sogar mit 4:3, wodurch im abschließenden Mixed sogar noch ums Unentschieden gekämpft werden musste. In 14 Tagen geht es mit einer Doppelrunde gegen die beiden letzten der Tabelle (Kärnten & Pressbaum) weiter. Hier wollen die Linzer wieder voll Punkten.

Ausschlaggebend für den Erfolg waren zum einen die Punkte in den Doppelbewerben, und dass diesmal beinahe alle knappen Sätze positiv entschieden wurden, aber auch dass die Wiener bei den Herren nicht in Bestbesetzung antraten. Erstmals seit langem konnte der UBC beide Herrendoppel gewinnen. Die neu zusammen gesetzten Paarungen Dominik Kronsteiner / Manuel Weber und Günter Kofler / Lukas Fröhlich siegten ebenso wie Zita Banhegyi / Katharina Hochmair. Während bei den Herren alle drei Einzel durch Günter Kofler, Thomas Wimmer und Dominik Kronsteiner in 2 Sätzen gewonnen wurden, musste sich Miriam Gruber nach Führung noch in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben. Den Schlusspunkt setzten Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi durch einen Dreisatzsieg im Mixed. „Die Sorgen um den Klassenerhalt gehören Dank dem Sieg praktisch der Vergangenheit an – jetzt versuchen wir mit guten Leistungen noch in den Kampf um das Aufstiegs-Play-off eingreifen zu können“, gibt UBC-Obmann Harald Starl die Parole für die Doppelrunde in zwei Wochen mit zwei Derbys gegen Linz und Alkoven aus.</p><p><em>BC Feldkirch 3:5 ASKÖ Traun</em><br>Teils sehr enge Partien lieferte sich der ASKÖ Traun auswärts gegen Tabellenführer BC Feldkirch. Mit einem 5:3-Erfolg kehren die Trauner heim und können bei gleich bleibenden Leistungen und einem Patzer der Feldkircher sogar auf die Tabellenführung hoffen.</p><p><em>BC Schweiger Sport Alkoven 8:0 BSC 70 Linz II</em><br>Im ersten Spiel der Rückrunde in der 2.Bundesliga empfing das Alkovener Team den Tabellenletzten BSC 70 Linz II. Die Gastgeber zeigten sich dabei von ihrer stärksten Seite und schickten die Linzer mit einer 8:0 Packung nach Hause. Die Alkovener Damen Iris Freimüller und Maria Steinmann waren ihren Gegnerinnen ganz klar überlegen und steuerten 3 Punkte zum Sieg bei. Die Herren hatten aber doch hart zu kämpfen, um das großartige Ergebnis sicher zu stellen. Die Doppel gewannen Thomas Hahn / Simon Rebhandl und Christoph Lessl/Lukas Rebhandl noch klar. Dann aber musste sich Lukas Rebhandl gegen den regierenden Landesmeister Harald Hochgatterer gewaltig anstrengen, ehe er ihn im 3.Satz doch knapp und mit etwas Glück 21:19 besiegten konnte. Christoph Lessl musste in seinem Spiel sogar zwei Matchbälle abwehren, siegte dann aber in der Verlängerung des 3.Satzes doch noch mit 23:21. Seine Routine spielte Thomas Hahn gegen den BORG-Leistungssportler Andrej Serov aus und siegte klar.

Wenn wir gegen Mödling voll punkten können, wäre das ganz wichtig für den weiteren Verlauf und die Position in der Tabelle für die Play-off Spiele. Die Vereinsführung ist mit dem ersten Teil der Saison absolut zufrieden. Jetzt heißt es in Richtung Play-off Spiele die richtigen Entscheidungen zu treffen und uns weiterhin optimal vorzubereiten.

Nachdem nun ENDLICH auch Sarina Kohlfürst wieder im Team des BSC 70 Linz mit dabei ist (sie laborierte an einer Muskelzerrung im Oberschenkel und musste die komplette Hinrunde auslassen), können wir auf den kompletten Bundesligakader zurückgreifen.</p><p><strong>ALKOVEN</strong><br>Am Samstag startet die Rückrunde der 2.Badminton-Bundesliga! In Alkoven kommt es gleich zu einem spannenden OÖ-Derby. Der BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven empfängt dabei am <strong>Sa 11.1.2014 15:00 in der Halle NMS Alkoven</strong> die 2.Mannschaft des BSC 70 Linz. In Linz konnten sich die Alkovener knapp mit 5:3 durchsetzen. Auch wenn der BSC derzeit den letzten Tabellenplatz einnimmt, ist das Team nicht zu unterschätzen. Knappe und interessante Partien sind zu erwarten. Wir werden alles daran setzen, unsere Zuschauer nicht zu enttäuschen und hoffen auf einen Sieg!

Mannschaft des BSC 70 Linz wieder aus dem Ländle. Bereits im Vorfeld wusste man, dass alles passen muss um die Heimstarken Wolfurter einen Punkt abknüpfen zu können. Aber: Eine Niederlage die viele positive Aspekte hat. Sarina Kohlfürst hat sich jetzt wohl wieder aus ihrem Tief gespielt. Sie hat total überrascht und die aktuelle Staatsmeisterin im Damen Einzel Alexandra Mathis besiegt. Nach zuletzt durchwachsenen Leistungen konnte sie 1 Woche nach den Staatsmeisterschaften mit 21-19, 3-21, 21-13 gewinnen. Kek Jamnik konnte auch endlich wieder eine bessere Leistung bieten und gewann in 2 Sätzen gegen Moritz Kaufmann. „Die Formkurve zeigt bei den Spielern wieder stark nach oben – ein wichtiger Schritt in Richtung Play-off. Nur dort zählt es für uns – dort ist die beste Leistung abzurufen. Dass wir auf den 4. Tabellenplatz zurückgerutscht sind ist für uns überhaupt kein Problem, auch wenn wir lieber weiter oben geblieben wären. Heute konnten wir auch Manuel Berger und Flo Baumgartner eine Chance in der 1. Mannschaft geben. Beide konnten mit guten Leistungen überzeugen. Schön zu wissen, dass wir auch gute heimische Spieler haben, welche auch in der 1. Mannschaft ohne Leistungsverlust mitspielen können. Beide spielten zuletzt in der 2. Liga und der 2. Mannschaft für den BSC 70 Linz“, weiß Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger viel Positives trotz der 2.

Das UBC-Rumpfteam musste sich nur knapp mit 3-5 im Ländle gegen Leader Feldkirch geschlagen geben. Mit Günter Kofler fällt ein weiterer Leistungsträger verletzt aus.<br>Eine fast perfekte Saison absolvierten die Badminton-Asse des UBC Vorchdorf, doch nun führen Verletzungen das Team in Schwierigkeiten. Beim Auswärts-Schlagerspiel in Feldkirch mussten die Vorchdorfer mit Dominik Kronsteiner, Miriam Gruber und Thomas Wimmer drei Leistungsträger vorgeben. Zudem mussten Günter Kofler und Lukas Fröhlich mit leichten Blessuren antreten.<br>Obwohl viele mit einem Debakel rechneten, wehrten sich die Oberösterreicher gehörig. Trotz Problemen konnten Günter Kofler / Lukas Fröhlich ihr Doppel in drei knappen Sätzen gewinnen. Nachdem Zita Banhegyi / Katharina Hochmeir ebenfalls ihr Doppel in drei Sätzen gewannen, führten die Vorchdorfer sogar nach den Doppelbegegnungen. Günter Kofler versuchte das Einzel trotz Verletzung zu bestreiten – jedoch musste er nach wenigen Ballwechseln kampflos aufgeben. Auch Lukas Fröhlich mühte sich mit einer Oberschenkelzerrung über die Runden – stemmte sich drei Sätze lang gegen die Niederlage. Dann brachte Katharina Hochmeir mit einem tollem Spiel gegen Favoritin Stenek das UBC-Team nochmals ran: 3-3. Doch die Sensation blieb aus. Florian Brandstötter verlor in drei knappen Sätzen ebenso wie das Mixed von Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi.<br>„Toll gekämpft,“ selten war UBC Obmann Harald Starl bei einer Niederlage seiner Mannschaft so zufrieden. Doch vor dem letzten Saisonspiel gegen Traun (<strong>Sa., 1. März 2014, 15 Uhr Sporthalle Vorchdorf</strong>) gehen dem UBC-Team schön langsam die Spieler aus.  </p><p>Bericht: Simon Moser, Reinhard Hechenberger, Harald Starl<br>Foto: Manfred Pichler</p>","2014-02-05","/content/news/BSC-70-Linz-I-zehrt-von-den-Erfolgen-der-Vorrunden-ASKOE-Traun-ist-im-Aufstiegs-Play-Off/5b9abfa1f1880.png","4");

Abstiegsplatz neben Fixabsteiger Steyr, die allerdings den Linzern vom BSC in der letzten Runde durchaus noch ein Schnippchen schlagen könnten, wenn es bei Kirchdorf gegen BC Windischgarsten zu einem Unentschieden kommt.</p><p>Dennoch ist es nicht zu erwarten, dass gerade Steyr im letzten Spiel gegen den BSC 70 Linz einen Sieg erspielt. Daher wird wohl der 2. Abstiegsplatz im Spiel zwischen Kirchdorf und BC Windischgarsten ermittelt. Im Duell um den Landesmeistertitel hat Ohlsdorf gegen Union Windischgarsten zwei Trümpfe in der Hand. Einerseits das Heimrecht und im Falle eines Unentschiedens das bessere Spielverhältnis. Wenn man eine Bilanz der 1. Landesliga ziehen möchte, so hat Kirchdorf doch eher überrascht, da sie mit Ausnahme von Union Windischgarsten jedes Team zumindest einmal besiegt haben und damit eine ausgeglichene Bilanz gegen alle Gegner in der Liga aufweisen. Kann man eigentlich nur noch zu dieser Leistung in der heurigen Meisterschaft gratulieren.</p><p>In den 2. Landesligen stehen Auf- und Absteiger bereits vor der letzten Runde fest, wenn man davon ausgeht, dass jede Mannschaft vollständig antritt.</p><p>Selbiges gilt auch für die Bezirksligen, wo die Aufsteiger auch bereits fix sind, wenn alle Mannschaften vollständig antreten. </p><p>In den 1. Klassen stehen die Aufsteiger auch bereits fest. Hier darf man lediglich auf das Antreten zum Lederhosenmatch in der 1. Klasse Nord warten.</p><p>Wir werden an geeigneter Stelle berichten.</p><p>In den beiden 2. Klassen sind die beiden Aufsteiger schon seit einiger Zeit fix und man kann einem Verein in der OÖMM zu gleich 3 Meistertiteln gratulieren. BC Schweigersport Alkoven ist in allen Klassen und Ligen, in denen sie in der OÖMM angetreten sind Meister dieser Klasse bzw. Liga. Auch eine tolle Leistung. Nun darf man auf die letzten Entscheidungen in der noch ausstehenden Runde blicken und die wohl spannendste 1. Landesliga der Geschichte blicken, die bis zur vorletzten Runde komplett offen gestaltet war. </p><p>Bis bald … Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2014-03-26","/content/news/nach-Runde-9-hellip-von-Klaus-Mitterhauser/5b9d0377be4b1.png","10");

Unter anderem Sport Landesrat Michael Strugl, Leichtathletik Ikone Günther Weidlinger und einige Spieler der SV JOSKO Ried.</p><p>Am Freitag, 14.3. betreuten Garsleitner Markus, Dietrich Simone und Rabel Andreas den Stand des OÖ Badmintonverbandes. Von 08.30 Uhr bis 15.50 Uhr besuchten sehr viele Schüler den Stand. Es gab viele Interessenten (großteils Schüler) für die Vereine aus Braunau, Andorf und Münzkirchen. Die Liste mit den Daten wird den Vereinen übermittelt. Auch für Ried sind einige Schüler vorgemerkt, die ein Probetraining absolvieren möchten.</p><p>Samstag, 15.3. waren 4 Vereinsvertreter von St. Marienkirchen von 10.00 bis 17.00 Uhr im Einsatz. Da gab es hauptsächlich Erwachsene die sich erkundigten. Das Spielfeld war durchgehend belegt.</p><p>Sonntag, 16.3. war Peter Zauner vor Ort. Auch hier war sehr viel los auf dem Badminton Court. Es waren auch vermehrt Kinder aus der Linzer Region, die die Sportart Badminton ausprobierten und bei einem Schußbewerb um Original Wettkampf T-Shirts von Peter Zauner als Preise kämpften. Weiters schauten auch Günther Weidlinger und einige Kicker der SV Josko Ried beim Badmintonfeld vorbei und spielten ein paar Schläge.</p><p>Alles in allem ist die Sport&Fun Messe eine Super Veranstaltung, um wieder mehr Menschen zum Sport zu bringen. Vor allem für die Sportart Badminton ist die Messe eine ideale Möglichkeit Werbung für unseren Sport zu machen und viele Kinder dazu zu bringen, in den nächst gelegenen Vereinen Badminton zu spielen.</p><p>Auf den Fotos zu sehen: Peter Zauner mit Spielern der SV Josko Ried, Leichtathletik Ikone Günther Weidlinger mit Peter Zauner<br><a href=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/188b5c89128ec211366d31712b66a841.jpg\"><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"/content/news/Messe-Sport-amp-Fun-in-RiedInnkreis/5b9d03ea5a74e.png\" alt=\"188b5c89128ec211366d31712b66a841\" srcset=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/188b5c89128ec211366d31712b66a841.jpg 800w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/188b5c89128ec211366d31712b66a841-120x90.jpg 120w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/188b5c89128ec211366d31712b66a841-241x180.jpg 241w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/188b5c89128ec211366d31712b66a841-723x540.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" width=\"800\" height=\"597\"></a><br><a href=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/99eb3ebf1a1162fb4d8c8ba427269963.jpg\"><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"/content/news/Messe-Sport-amp-Fun-in-RiedInnkreis/5b9d03ea713bd.png\" alt=\"99eb3ebf1a1162fb4d8c8ba427269963\" srcset=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/99eb3ebf1a1162fb4d8c8ba427269963.jpg 800w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/99eb3ebf1a1162fb4d8c8ba427269963-120x90.jpg 120w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/99eb3ebf1a1162fb4d8c8ba427269963-241x180.jpg 241w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/99eb3ebf1a1162fb4d8c8ba427269963-723x540.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" width=\"800\" height=\"597\"></a><br><a href=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/1ad300117d6b88bbb2e556e227780d7b.jpg\"><img SRCX=\"/content/news/Messe-Sport-amp-Fun-in-RiedInnkreis/5b9d03ea5a74e.png\" alt=\"1ad300117d6b88bbb2e556e227780d7b\" srcset=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/1ad300117d6b88bbb2e556e227780d7b.jpg 800w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/1ad300117d6b88bbb2e556e227780d7b-120x90.jpg 120w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/1ad300117d6b88bbb2e556e227780d7b-241x180.jpg 241w, http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/1ad300117d6b88bbb2e556e227780d7b-723x540.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" width=\"800\" height=\"597\"></a></p><p><img SRCX=\"/content/news/Messe-Sport-amp-Fun-in-RiedInnkreis/5b9d03ea5a74e.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\"></p>","2014-03-20","/content/news/Messe-Sport-amp-Fun-in-RiedInnkreis/5b9d03ea4d5c9.png","5");

Über 102 Nachwuchsspielerinnen und -spieler aus 12 Vereinen ermittelten in insgesamt fast 200 Spielen die Landesmeister der Klassen U11, U13, U15, U17, U19 und U22 in den Disziplinen Einzel, Doppel und Mixed.<br>Unter der erfahrenen Turnierleitung des BSC 70 Linz als Ausrichterverein wurden die Wettkämpfe auch aufgrund der ausgesprochen hohen Disziplin der Spielerinnen und Spieler sowie deren Coaches zu einem fairen und sehr schönen Sportfest für den OÖ Badminton Nachwuchs. Am Sonntag gegen 14 Uhr standen dann letztendlich alle Siegerinnen und Sieger fest und konnten sich feiern lassen.</p><p>„Unsere besten Landesmeisterschaften“ – Eine kleine Nachbetrachtung aus Ohlsdorfer Sicht.<br>Vorerst danke an den BSC 70 (Mitterhauser Klaus) für die reibungslose Abwicklung der Landesmeisterschaften.<br>In unserer Vereinschronik habe ich weit zurückgeblättert und gesehen, dass die Union Ohlsdorf in den letzten Jahren immer die Medaillenstatistik angeführt hat. Mit 9,5 Goldenen haben wir aber unseren eigenen Rekord aus dem Jahre 2009 gebrochen. Heuer haben wir auch erstmals in jeder Altersstufe Medaillen geholt und außer U15 auch in jeder Alterstufe mindestens einen Titel. Dieses Ergebnis werden wir wohl kaum mehr erreichen können. Sehr erfreulich war, dass wieder aus 11 Vereinen Spieler am Start waren, die uns in Zukunft gehörig zusetzen werden – und das ist gut so. Leider haben aber auch einige Vereine, die früher gute Nachwuchsarbeit geleistet haben, gefehlt.<br><a href=\"http://www.badminton-ooe.at/wp-content/uploads/DSC_3601_fabian-diving.jpg\"><img

Rund 100 Teilnehmer trafen sich dort beim letzten österreichischen Ranglistenturnier der heurigen Saison. Oberösterreich war mit Nachwuchsspielern aus Wels, Kirchdorf, Ohlsdorf, Neuhofen und ASKÖ Linz vertreten.</p><p>Wie bereits bei den beiden vorangegangenen österreichischen Ranglistenturnieren, zeigten unsere Nachwuchstalente ihr spielerisches Können.<br>So war der U15 Bewerb bei den Burschen fest in der Hand der beiden Welser Dominik und Luka Leko. Ohne Satzverlust entschieden die Beiden den Doppelbewerb für sich. Gregor Radner (Union Kirchdorf) gelang mit seinem Salzburger Partner der dritte Rang. Das Einzel war eine klare Angelegenheit für Dominik Leko, der sich den Sieg mit nur einem verlorenen Satz in vier Spielen sicherte. Im Mixedbewerb erspielten Luka Leko und Hannah Mairhofer vom ABV Wels den dritten Rang. Die tollen Ergebnisse in den U15-Bewerben rundeten Florian Harwöck (ABV Wels) im Einzel-B-Bewerb, sowie Hannah Mairhofer (ABV Wels) mit ihrer Ohlsdorfer Partnerin Christine Stadlmayr im Doppel mit einem jeweils dritten Rang ab. Jan-Mattheo Brüggenwerth unterlag Florian Harwöck im kleinen Finale und wurde im U15-B-Bewerb Vierter.</p><p>Bei den Jüngeren erreichte der Welser David Weber im Einzel den vierten, mit seinem Alexander Huemer aus Ohlsdorf im Doppel sogar den zweiten Platz.

Dort wartet der Wunschgegner Mödling, mit dem man noch eine Rechnung offen hat (nach einem Unentschieden in der Hinrunde folgte eine Niederlage in der Rückrunde) und wohl alles daran gesetzt wird ins Halbfinale einzuziehen.<br>Obmann Hechenberger gibt sich optimistisch: „Bei allen Leistungsträgern zeigt die Formkurve wieder stark nach oben, ein wichtiger Schritt für das Playoff. Heute konnten wir neben Geburtstagskind Natalie Hofinger (die ihr Debüt in der 1. Bundesliga spielte) auch Flo Baumgartner wieder eine Chance in der 1. Mannschaft geben.

So gingen die Vorarlberger bereits mit 2:0 ins Spiel, da das DE und das DD w.o. gegeben werden mussten. Nach den beiden gewonnenen Herrendoppel durch Thomas Hahn/Simon Rebhandl und Christoph Lessl/Lukas Rebhandl kam aber noch einmal Hoffnung auf. Dann aber konnten die Herren ihre Form in den Einzelspielen nicht abrufen und verloren ihre Spiele. Den dritten Punkt holte in gewohnter Manier das Mixed Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl. Damit steht das Alkovener Team am Ende der Meisterschaft auf dem vierten Tabellenplatz.

Aber es kann durchaus zum VIZE-STAATSMEISTER 2013/2014 gratuliert werden!</p><p>„Unser Ziel war der Aufstieg in das Bundesligafinale, und nach beinahe 15 Jahren haben wir dieses Ziel erreicht. Dass es mit dem Staatsmeistertitel nicht geklappt hat ist schade“, bilanziert Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger rückblickend. „Die Spieler haben gegen Wien toll gekämpft aber schlussendlich hat auch das Quäntchen Glück gefehlt. Anerkennen muss man jedoch auch, dass WBH Wien seit 2002  7x den Mannschaftsstaatsmeistertitel geholt hat und damit auch die erfolgreichste Mannschaft der letzten Jahre ist.“ Schlussendlich setzte sich mit Wien die beste und konstantere Mannschaft im Finale durch. Nach einem 4:2 im ersten Finalspiel endete das 2. Spiel 5:1 für Wien, wobei das Ergebnis nicht den engen Spielverlauf der Begegnung widerspiegelt. Verletzungsbedingt mussten beim BSC 70 Linz einige Umstellungen im Team gemacht werden. Scheinbar war das gar nicht der falsche Ansatz, denn die Spiele in Wien standen jeweils auf sehr hohem Niveau. Im 1. Herren Doppel verlangten Horvat/Sepec Pratama/Nottingham alles ab, mussten sich aber in 2. Sätzen geschlagen geben. Auch das Damen Doppel war nichts für schwache Nerven: Im dritten Satz ging das Spiel mit 22:20 zugunsten von Wien aus. Diese Niederlage war schon so etwas wie eine kleine Vorentscheidung. Im 1. Herren Einzel war für Peyo Boychinov Revanche gegen den stärksten Herren der Liga, Adi Pratama, angesagt. Erst gegen Ende des 3. Satzes konnte Adi Pratama durch leichtere Fehler von Peyo Boychinov das Spiel gewinnen. Das Damen Einzel ging ebenfalls über drei Sätze und wiederum hatte Wien das bessere Ende für sich. Nach schwächerem Start konnte dann doch noch das starke Linzer Mixed in 3 Sätzen ein Spiel für Linz holen. Im 2. Herren Einzel musste dann Kek Jamnik für den verletzten Miha Sepec einspringen. Leider ging er mit 0:2 Sätzen unter und damit gewann Wien auch das 2. Finalspiel mit 5:1. Nachdem Wien uneinholbar vorne lag, erfolgte der Abbruch und dem Linzer Daniel Walchshofer blieb sein erstes Spiel (3. HE) in einem Bundesliga-Finale verwehrt.</p><p>Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger: „Der BSC 70 Linz ist stolz über die abgelaufene Saison und den Vizemeistertitel 2013/2014. Ein großer Dank gilt den Spielern der Mannschaft für die tolle Saison, aber auch allen Fans und Unterstützern.“</p><p>————————–</p><p><strong>VORBERICHT 2. Finalspiel</strong></p><p>Durch das bessere Satzverhältnis von 9:4 wurde das 1. Finalspiel, das am 1. Mai in er Solarcity stattfand, bereits bei 4:2 für Wien abgebrochen, weil Wien damit im ersten Spiel uneinholbar war. Damit liegt Wien 1:0 vorne. Der BSC 70 Linz wird beim Rückspiel am Samstag 3. Mai in Wien alles daran setzen gleichzuziehen und die Wiener ins entscheidende dritte Finalspiel zu zwingen.</p><p>————————–</p><p><strong>VORBERICHT 1. Finalspiel</strong></p><p><strong>Am Do. 1.5.2014, ab 15 Uhr startet die Finalserie der „best of three“ Serie in Linz.</strong></p><p>„Unser Ziel war der Aufstieg in das Bundesliga-Finale, nach beinahe 15 Jahren konnten wir die Tür zum Finale endlich wieder öffnen“, bilanziert Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger die bisherige erfolgreiche Saison. „Die Spieler haben im Halbfinale gegen Mödling toll gekämpft und schlussendlich verdient gewonnen. Dennoch war es eine sehr enge Begegnung! Mit Wien wartet eine nicht minder enge Begegnung. ABER“, so Hechenberger weiter, „in einem Finale ist alles möglich. Wir werden wieder, angepasst an den Gegner, eine bestmögliche Aufstellung finden.“</p><p>Mit Wien spielt man gegen den Verein, gegen den man in den vergangenen Jahren mehrmals im Halbfinale verloren hat. Es ist das erste Aufeinandertreffen in einem Finale. Anerkennen muss man auch, dass WBH Wien seit 2002 6x den Mannschaftsstaatsmeistertitel geholt hat und damit auch die erfolgreichste Mannschaft der letzten Jahre ist.</p><p><strong>Geschichte des BSC 70 Linz:</strong><br>Der Askö BSC 70 Linz spielt seit nunmehr 36 Jahren ununterbrochen in der Badminton-Bundesliga; es gibt kein Team das annähernd so viele Jahre auf höchsten Niveau spielt – 6 Mal konnte man in dieser Zeit den Staatsmeistertitel holen und etliche Male den Vize-Staatsmeistertitel. 1992 krönte sich der BSC 70 Linz als erste und einzige Mannschaft Österreichs zum Europacupsieger. In der jüngsten Vergangenheit holte man in den Jahren 2005 – 2010 und in der Saison 2012/2013 den 3. Platz, hier verlor man durchwegs immer ganz knapp und meistens gegen den späteren Mannschaftsmeister.</p><p>Spielmodus Halbfinale:<br>1.  1. Herren – Doppel<br>2.  Damen – Doppel<br>3.  1.

Und wie die Endtabellen zeigen, hab ich mich mit meiner Einschätzung und Meistervorhersage nach Runde 9 gehörig geirrt. Denn sowohl ABV Wels als auch Union Urfahr haben BC Schweigersport Alkoven noch den Meistertitel in der Bezirksliga Nord und der 2. Landesliga Nord noch im letzten Moment entrissen. Beide Male war es sehr knapp und das bessere Spielverhältnis entschied für Wels und Urfahr. Aber nun der Reihe nach zu den einzelnen Ligen.</p><p>Meister in der 1. Landesliga und damit OÖ Mannschaftslandesmeister wurde Union Ohlsdorf 1, die es diese Saison wieder beim Aufstiegsturnier versuchen werden, den Aufstieg in die 2. Bundesliga zu schaffen. Vorige Saison haben sie es nicht geschafft und der BSC 70 Linz blieb in der 2. Bundesliga. Diese Saison bekommen sie wiederum starke Konkurrenz, denn es gibt auch weitere starke Aufstiegsbestrebungen aus anderen Bundesländern. Wir wünschen den Oberösterreichischen Vertretern viel Glück und hoffen auch nächste Saison wieder auf viele OÖ Vereine in der 2. Bundesliga. Fast hätte es noch eine Überraschung gegeben, denn Steyr hat gerade im Abstiegskampf dem BSC 70 Linz noch ein Unentschieden abverlangt und somit doch zumindest auch einen Punkteerfolg in der 1. Landesliga erreicht. Richtig spannend war auch das Spiel BC Windischgarsten gegen Union Kirchdorf, die mit Ausnahme von BC Windischgarsten gegen jeden anderen Gegner der 1. LL Punkte erzielt haben.<br>Leider wurde dies nicht ausreichend belohnt und so müssen die Kirchdorfer auf Ohlsdorfer Unterstützung hoffen um den Klassenerhalt zu schaffen.<br>Voraussetzung hierfür wäre, dass der BSC 70 Linz im Falle eines Abstiegs aus der 2. Bundesliga die Mannschaft nicht absteigen lässt, sondern auflöst.<br>Soweit die 1. Landesliga, die die spannendste der letzten 10 oder sogar 20 Jahre war.</p><p>Die beiden 2. Landesligen haben mit Union Urfahr 1 und UBC Neuhofen 1 die beiden Aufsteiger und Meister und mit SK VÖEST 1 und USC Attergau die beiden Absteiger. Hier ist generell zu sagen, dass es in der 2. Landesliga Nord am Schluss einiges spannender um die Meisterschaft zuging und es ein echtes Finale gab. Für den UBC Neuhofen, der Verein, der mit insgesamt 7 Mannschaften in der OÖMM vertreten ist und der in allen Begegnungen stets vollständig antretende Mannschaften hatte, ist der Aufstieg in die 1.<br>Landesliga der größte bisherige Erfolg in der Vereinsgeschichte. Mal sehen, ob die beiden Aufsteiger aus der 2. Landesliga nächste Saison das gleiche Schicksal ereilt, wie den meisten der Aufsteigern der letzten Saisonen. In den 2. Landesligen brachte die Nicht Antrittspunkt Regelung doch einige Verschiebungen in der Meisterschaft. Trotzdem zeigt es auch, dass sich die Mannschaften um Spielerinnen und Spieler bemühen, um die Antrittspunkte zu erhalten.</p><p>In den beiden Bezirksligen war wiederum die Bezirksliga Nord die spannendere um den Meistertitel. Hier setzte sich dann auch gegen meine Aussagen aus dem Bericht nach Runde 9 doch noch ABV Wels 1 gegen BC Schweigersport Alkoven 3 durch. Wieder entschied das bessere Spielverhältnis über den Meistertitel.<br>Über den Abstieg in der Bezirksliga Nord entschied letztendlich die Nicht Antrittspunkt Regelung. In der Bezirksliga Süd heißt der Absteiger Union Kirchdorf 2, vielleicht auch deshalb, weil sie in der 1. Landesliga bei so mancher Begegnung aushelfen mussten und daher nicht immer mit der 1. Auswahl antreten konnten.</p><p>In den beiden ersten Klassen, stand vor der letzten Runde sowieso schon alles fest. In der 1. Klasse Nord gab es das vielleicht mit Spannung erwartete Lederhosenmatch vom quasi „Non Playing Captain“ des BSC 70 Linz 4 (Bild). Leider war ich nicht ganz fit und von „Heuschnupfen“ geplagt, sodass es noch etwas schwieriger wurde, das Match halbwegs ausgeglichen zu halten.<br>Ich habe das Match letztendlich in 2 Sätzen verloren. Übrigens entstand nun auch die Idee ein Trachtenturnier zu veranstalten. Mal sehen, ob das nicht nur bei einer Idee bleibt. Ein kleiner Gruß an ATV Andorf 2: Sollte der BSC<br>70 Linz 4 wie letzte Saison noch einmal eine Chance erhalten, als Zweitplatzierter aufsteigen zu können, dann freut sich die komplette Mannschaft auf eine neuerliche Begegnung in der nächsten Saison.</p><p>In den beiden 2. Klassen war generell von Beginn mit BC Schweigersport Alkoven und Union Windischgarsten der Aufsteiger für nächste Saison klar.<br>Alkoven musste nur einmal ein Unentschieden hinnehmen, während Union Windischgarsten alle Spiele gewann und nur 8 Spielpunkte bzw. insgesamt nur<br>23 Satzverluste hinnehmen musste. Ich gehe davon aus, dass zumindest Union Windischgarsten auch nächste Saison in der 1. Klasse nur schwer zu schlagen sein wird.</p><p>In Vorfreude auf die nächste Saison und auf ein Wiedersehen bei der Saisonabschlussbesprechung </p><p>… Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2014-04-16","/content/news/hellip-nach-Runde-10/5b9d05cf585d4.png","5");

Die Stimmung war phänomenal!</p><p>Im 1. Spiel (1.

Satzes der Faden und sie fand nicht mehr zurück ins Spiel – immerhin: wieder ein wichtiger Satz gewonnen.<br>Nach den ersten vier Spielen steht es 1:3. Ein aus Sicht des BSC 70 Linz mit 21-19 21-13 klares Mixed brachte den Anschlusspunkt zum 2:3. Aus Sicht der Linzer Mannschaftsaufstellung war klar, dass jetzt die entscheidenden Spiele folgen werden. Miha Sepec musste diesmal im zweiten Herreneinzel weitaus mehr kämpfen. Ein tolles Spiel ging schlussendlich im 3. Satz 21-17 an ihn.<br>Neuer Stand: 3:3. Gewinnt Kek Jamnik das dritte Herreneinzel in zwei Sätzen, wäre dem BSC 70 Linz der Finaleinzug nicht mehr zu nehmen. Im ersten Satz schien mit einem 21-19 doch alles glatt zu gehen. Leider schien es nicht Jamniks Tag zu sein und sein Gegner Christoph Syrch konnte sein Potential zeigen. Es folgt ein deutlicher zweiter Satz mit 7-21. Parallel begann das zweite Herrendoppel, das mit einem klaren 21-19 21-13 den Einzug ins Finale sicherte. Nun konnte auch endlich Jamnik befreit aufspielen und drehte das bereits verloren geglaubte Spiel noch mit 25:23.</p><p>Der BSC 70 I steht im Finale der im Kampf um den Titel des Mannschaftsstaatsmeisters!

Wir haben die Mannschaft um die im Grunddurchgang ungeschlagenen Mödlinger zu bezwingen und in das Finale einzuziehen.“ Mödling wird mit Hilfe des Heimpublikums alles daran setzen ein Entscheidungsspiel zu erzwingen (dieses fände gleich am So 13.4.2014 13:00 in Mödling statt).

Spiel der best of three Serie in der Solar City Halle in Linz statt – Eintritt frei!</strong></p><p>Erwartungsgemäß gibt BSC 70 Linz-Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger den Einzug ins Finale als klares Ziel der nächsten zwei/drei Spiele und damit den Aufstieg in das Bundesliga-Finale vor. „Die Spieler des Teams haben sich ohne Verletzungen optimal auf das Halbfinale vorbereiten können und sind topfit und motiviert für das Spiel gegen Mödling. Wir haben in der laufenden Saison zwar nur einen Punkt gegen die Mödlinger geholt, aber ein Semifinale ist eine ganz neue Situation. Auch wenn es im Grunddurchgang immer sehr eng und wohl zu Gunsten der Mödlinger ausging, ist man sicher, zumindest einen kleinen Vorteil zu haben: Wir kennen die Situation in einem Bundesliga Halbfinale nur zu gut und für unseren Verein und das aktuelle Team sollte es diesmal klappen.“</p><p>Den 3. Platz in der Bundesliga holte der BSC 70 Linz in den Jahren 2005 – 2010 und 2013 mit durchwegs ganz knappen Niederlagen, meistens gegen den späteren Mannschaftsmeister. Obmann Hechenberger sieht es also wieder an der Zeit, das Finale der Bundesliga zu erreichen: „Im Grunddurchgang war unser Ziel der 1. Platz und damit mögliche Heimspiele zu den entscheidenden Spielen im Playoff. Mit dem Herbstmeistertitel haben wir das auch noch untermauert.“</p><p>Im Play-off spielt der 1. der Tabelle gegen den 4. und der 2. gegen den 3, also Mödling – BSC 70 Linz und Wien – Wolfurt. Damit kommt es im 2. Halbfinale zum Aufeinandertreffen der letztjährigen Finalisten und im 1. Halbfinale zum Aufeinandertreffen des längst dienenden Bundesligateams BSC 70 Linz gegen Aufsteiger Mödling. (Der BSC 70 Linz spielt seit über 30 Jahren ununterbrochen in der Badminton Bundesliga, was keine andere Mannschaft bisher geschafft hat.)</p><p><em><strong>Spielmodus Halbfinale:</strong></em><br>Der Referee legt die Spielreihenfolge für einen bestmöglichen zeitlichen Ablauf fest. Dabei müssen die fünf Disziplinen (HE, DE, HD, DD, Mix) zur Austragung kommen. Die Ergebnisse werden nicht saldiert sondern mit einem Sieg gewertet. Bei einem Unentschieden gibt es ebenfalls durch das bessere Satz- bzw. Punkteverhältnis einen Sieger.

Im Finale mussten sie sich jedoch in 2 knappen Sätzen gegen Bittenauer/Schlemmer geschlagen geben, aber damit wandert auch der Herrendoppel-Vizejuniorenmeistertitel nach OÖ (Silber).</p><p>Ebenfalls im Herrendoppel erfolgreich war <strong>Andrej Serov</strong> (Union Ohlsdorf), der mit seinem Partner aus Graz ebenfalls die Bronze Medaille in diesem Bewerb erkämpfte.</p><p>Über zwei Medaillen durfte sich auch <strong>Katharina Hochmeir</strong> (Union Ohlsdorf) freuen: Die erst 15-jährige gewann im Damendoppel mit Vereinskollegin <strong>Jana Haas</strong> die Silber-Medaille. Die beiden setzten sich mit einer tollen Leistung im Halbfinale gegen Sorger/Meinke durch, im Finale konnten sie jedoch nicht mehr an die Leistung anknüpfen und verloren gegen Ertl/Demmelmayer. Im Mixed Doppel errang Katharina Hochmeir mit Lukas Fröhlich die Bronze Medaille, nachdem sie das Viertelfinale gegen Jana Haas & Andrej Serov gewonnen hatten.</p><p>Sowohl im Dameneinzel als auch im Herreneinzel kamen die Oberösterreicher nicht über das Viertelfinale hinaus.

Im Chor der Schülermannschaften von Vereinen, die ausschließlich in der 1. oder 2.

Darauf folgten allerdings Niederlagen gegen die favorisierten Teams aus Vorarlberg und Niederösterreich. Trotzdem fehlte nur ein gewonnenes Spiel gegen Wien, um den dritten Platz, und damit eine Medaille erringen zu können. Da auch die Partien der anderen Gegner ziemlich ausgeglichen verliefen, reichte es letztendlich nur für den fünften Gesamtrang.</p><p>„Trotzdem sind wir mit dem Ergebnis sehr zufrieden. Man muss bedenken, dass unsere Gegner ausschließlich Vereine aus den beiden höchsten österreichischen Ligen waren, und wir hier mitspielen.

Medigames (quasi die inoffizielle Weltmeisterschaft der medizinischen Berufe) in Wels statt. Der ABV Wels trug für den französischen Veranstalter das Badmintonturnier aus.</p><p>Insgesamt waren 22 Teilnehmer aus Österreich, Deutschland, Slowenien, Ungarn, Polen, Portugal, Belgien und Chile am Start. Die Sieger wurden sowohl in den jeweiligen Altersklassen, sowie in Doppel- und Mixed-Bewerben und bei den Herren in einer Allgemeinklasse ermittelt. So wurden an drei Halbtagen insgesamt 103 Spiele absolviert. Der Turnierablauf war alles andere als leicht, da im Vorfeld nicht bekannt war, dass einige der Teilnehmer gleichzeitig auch an anderen Sportbewerben teilnahmen und dann für einige Zeit nicht in der Halle anwesend waren. Turnierleiter Michi Harwöck hat jedoch auch diese knifflige Herausforderung bravourös gemeistert. Weiters war die offizielle Turniersprache Englisch, was die Organisation auch nicht erleichterte.</p><p>Als einzige österreichische Teilnehmer nahmen vom ABV Wels mit Bernhard Huber (Altersklasse unter 35) und Wolfgang Schwetz (Altersklasse 45 – 55) zwei Spieler Teil und beide holten sich bei diesen Weltspielen Medaillen. Bernhard Huber musste sich in seiner Altersklasse dem späteren Sieger aus Chile im Entscheidungssatz denkbar knapp mit 22:24 geschlagen geben und holte sich die Silbermedaille. Ebenfalls Silber errang Wolfgang Schwetz mit seinem portugiesischen Partner im Doppelbewerb. Der Sieg in den Allgemeinklassen ging bei den Damen nach Portugal und bei den Herren nach Ungarn.</p><p>Von Seiten der Spieler gab es für den Verein großes Lob für die ausgezeichnete Abwicklung und die Flexibilität in der Spielaustragung. Insgesamt investierte das ABV-Team rund 90 Mannstunden für die Abwicklung des Turniers.   </p><p>Bericht & Foto: ABV Wels</p>","2014-06-29","/content/news/ABV-Wels-fuehrte-die-internationalen-Medigames-durch/5b9d0823d3cbd.png","3");

Dieser Abstand entspricht dem Abstand der Aufschlaglinien auf einem Tennisspielfeld, die 5,5 m entsprechen der halben Breite eines Tennisplatzes. Durch auflegbare Gummilinien kann daher jeder Tennisplatz einfach in einen Speed-Badminton-Court verwandelt werden. Hierbei wird mit einem sog. Match Speeder gespielt. Bei den Jugendlichen (bis 14 Jahre) wird auf 8,80 m Abstand gespielt und dies mit dem sog. Fun Speeder. Beide Spielvarianten werden ohne Netz gespielt.</p><p>Spielsatz<br>Ein Spielsatz endet mit 16 Gewinnpunkten. Bei 15:15 geht der Satz in die Verlängerung, wobei zum Sieg zwei Punkte Vorsprung nötig sind. Ein Match geht grundsätzlich über drei Gewinnsätze. Bei Turnieren kann der jeweilige Veranstalter bis zum Halbfinale auch Spiele mit lediglich zwei Gewinnsätzen gestatten.</p><p>Aufschlag<br>Das Recht des ersten Aufschlags und die Wahl der Seite wird in der Regel durch das Werfen einer Münze entschieden (hierfür kann auch der Speeder benutzt werden, indem er in die Luft geworfen wird und derjenige das Wahlrecht erhält, zu dem die Spitze des Speeders näher liegt). Aufgeschlagen wird im Block mit drei Aufschlägen pro Spieler. Jeder gespielte Ballwechsel punktet. Beim Gleichstand von 15:15 wechselt das Aufschlagsrecht nach jedem Punkt. Der Aufschlag erfolgt in einem gedachten Aufschlagrechteck, das über die gesamte Breite des Courts geht und 3 m hinter der vorderen, sogenannten Angriffslinie beginnt. Hierbei ist die Position in dem Aufschlagfeld egal. Die Aufschlagsline darf mit keinem Teil der Füße überquert werden. Der Aufschlag muss von unten ausgeführt werden. Die genaue Regel heißt hier: Im Moment des Treffpunktes muss der Speeder unter der schlägerführenden Hand geschlagen werden. Den ersten Aufschlag des nächsten Satzes hat derjenige, der im vorherigen Satz verloren hat.</p><p>Punktgewinn<br>Jeder Ballwechsel wird gezählt, sofern er nicht wiederholt werden muss. Gepunktet wird, wenn<br>•    kein vorschriftsmäßiger Aufschlag gelingt,<br>•    der Speeder den Boden oder die Decke berührt,<br>•    der Speeder im Spielfeld landet und nicht retourniert werden kann, wobei die Linien zum Spielfeld gerechnet werden,<br>•    der Speeder im „Aus“ landet,<br>•    der Speeder zweimal hintereinander geschlagen wird,<br>•    der Speeder den Körper berührt.<br>Wird ein Speeder außerhalb des Spielfeldes weitergespielt, gilt er als angenommen.<br>Seitenwechsel<br>Nach jedem Satz wird die Seite gewechselt, um die Chancengleichheit hinsichtlich Wind- und Lichtverhältnissen zu gewährleisten. Sollte es zu einem Entscheidungssatz kommen, werden die Seiten nach jeweils sechs gespielten Punkten gewechselt.</p>","2014-06-10","/content/news/3-Linzer-Speedmintonturnier-ndash-2862014-ndash-LinzUrfahr/5b9d08a8ec39d.png","2");

Leider gelang nach einer zwischenzeitlichen 18:14-Führung nicht der Satzgewinn.

Es war eine Freude, dass ich ihnen alles abverlangt habe um eine Runde weiter zu kommen.

In seinen Vorrundenspielen musste er sich etwas überraschend einem Kontrahenden aus der Steiermark geschlagen geben. Zu viele Eigenfehler und etwas Nervosität führten zu dieser Niederlage, was Rang zwei in seiner Gruppe bedeutete.

Nach hart umkämpften und sehr knappen drei Sätzen reichte es schlußendlich zur Silbermedaille.

Ein Satz wird bis 11 Punkte gespielt (ohne Verlängerung), es wird mit dem System Best-of-5 gespielt, d.h. wer zuerst 3 Sätze gewonnen hat, geht als Sieger vom Feld.</p><p>Für Wolfgang, der vor kurzem noch bei der Jugendolympiade war, war die Zählweise natürlich eine Umstellung:<br>„das alte Zählsystem wäre mir lieber gewesen, liegt mir glaub ich mehr. Das Finale gegen Luke Pearce aus England war sehr spannend (11:10, 10:11, 11:10, 11:9) aber auch das Halbfinale gegen Ricardo Silva aus Portugal war schon erdenklich knapp (11:6, 6:11, 11:7, 9:11, 11:7)“, berichtet Wolfgang direkt nach dem Finale.<br>Schlussendlich konnte sich Wolfgang mit gutem Spiel durchsetzen und auch mit dieser Zählweise den Sieg beim Internationalen Carlton Irish U19 Open 2014 einfahren.</p><p>Bericht: BSC 70 Linz</p><p><strong>Änderung Zählweise</strong></p><p>Für die BWF (Badminton World Federation) gibt es mehrere Gründe, warum eine Regeländerung angestrebt wird. So wird hier auf jeden Fall die ansteigende Dauer eines Spiels auf Topniveau als Hauptgrund genannt. Die maximale Matchdauer liegt mittlerweile bei knappen Spielen wieder bei über 1,5 Stunden.<br>Mit der nun zu testenden Variante soll nicht nur die Gesamtdauer verkürzt werden, sondern die Matches für das Publikum attraktiver werden. Viel schneller und natürlich auch öfter (weil jetzt best-of-5 anstatt best-of-3) kommt es zur Entscheidungssituation, ob man einen Satz gewinnt.<br>Unklar ist wann ggf. das neue Zählsystem endgültig eingeführt werden könnte (sofern die Testphase positiv verläuft). Normalerweise wäre das nur im Rahmen der nächsten BWF-Generalversammlung möglich, die allerdings erst im Mai 2015 startet. Hier startet jedoch auch die Olympiaqualifikation für Rio 2016. D.h. demnach scheint es aus derzeitiger Sicht eher unwahrscheinlich, dass eine Regeländerung noch vor den Olympischen Spielen passiert, da man die Änderung wohl nicht mitten in der Olympia-Qualfikationsperiode einführen kann.

Platz. Keiner der vier oö. Vereine der 2. Bundesliga kann in der Doppelrunde zwei Siege verbuchen – es bleibt spannend.</p><p><strong>1. Bundesliga</strong><br>Das vergangene Wochenende war ein turbulentes für die Spieler und die Vereinsleitung des BSC 70 Linz. Mit großen Ambitionen wurde in dieses Wochenende gegangen, denn „wir wussten um die Wichtigkeit dieser beide Spiele im weiteren Verlauf der Meisterschaft. Leider konnten wir ganz und gar nicht an die Leistung von Pressbaum anschließen. Das Glück war leider auch nicht an unserer Seite.“<br>Keine der entscheidenden 3-Satz-Matches des Tagen konnte der BSC 70 Linz für sich verbuchen. Darüber hinaus lief man im Sonntagsspiel auch noch einem 0:3 Rückstand nach. Schlussendlich hatte das Mixed den wichtigen Punkt zum Unentschieden am Schläger – eine „komfortable“ Führung im 3. Satz (18-13) konnte nicht in einen Matchsieg und dem rettenden Unentschieden geholt werden. Ein kleiner Trost war der Gewinn der 3 Herren-Einzel – endlich eine Leistung der Spieler die ihrem Niveau entspricht – welche die Mannschaft nochmals im Spiel gegen Wolfurt zurückgebracht hat.<br>„Die Einstellung und der Kampfgeist im Team waren da, leider konnten wir die entscheidenden Punkte nicht gemacht werden“, ist Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger enttäuscht, blickt aber bereits wieder nach vorne. Für einzelne Spieler im Team ist die Pause bis zum nächsten Match wichtig zur Leistungssteigerung. „Ich erwarte mir hier starke Verbesserungen um in dieser Saison konkurrenzfähig zu bleiben.“ Am 29.11.2014 geht es auswärts gegen Titelverteidiger Wien, ein wiederrum wichtige, jedoch keineswegs einfache Begegnung.</p><p><strong><br> 2. Bundesliga</strong><br>Keiner der vier oö. Vereine der 2. Bundesliga kann in der Doppelrunde zwei Siege verbuchen.</p><p><em>ASKÖ Traun</em><br>Beim Spitzenduell in der 2. Badminton-Bundesliga Askö Traun vs. BC Feldkirch am 26. Oktober in der HAKA-Arena gab es keinen Sieger. Die Mannschaften trennten sich mit einem gerechten 4:4 Unentschieden, das an Spannung kaum zu überbieten war. Vom Sieg bis zur Niederlage war für den Askö Traun in den letzten beiden Partien noch alles möglich.<br>Gewohnt souverän sorgten die Herrendoppel Koch/Serov und Zauner/Ostermann für die 2:0 Führung für die Gastgeber. Die Vorarlberger verkürzten nach dem Damendoppel, bei dem Hauser/Galos in 2 Sätzen unterlagen, auf 1:2. Jürgen Koch zeigte viel Sehenswertes im 1. Herreneinzel und erhöhte auf 3:1. Nach dem sicher gewonnenen 1. Satz von Jakob Ostermann im 2. Herreneinzel glaubten die ZuschauerInnen bereits an einen Sieg, ehe Jakob den 2. und 3. Satz noch abgeben musste. Damit wurde es eng für die TraunerInnen, da auch Barbara Galos im Dameneinzel unterlag. Ein großes Kämpferherz bewies Markus Ratzenböck, der im 3. Herreneinzel alles gab. Nach klar verlorenem ersten Satz holte er sich unter dem Jubel der Trauner Fans den 2. Satz. Im 3. Satz hat er 4 Matchbälle abgewehrt, dann den Sieg am Schläger, ehe er sich noch geschlagen geben musste. Das war ganz eng. Zeitgleich hatte bereits das Mixed begonnen, bei dem nun Zauner/Scheer unter Zugzwang waren, um noch ein Unentschieden zu “retten”. Auch diese Partie ging über 3 kräftezehrende Sätze, in denen sich die TraunerInnen mit einem hoch motivierten Peter Zauner den Sieg holten. Fazit: Ein gerechtes Unentschieden mit vielen sehenswerten Spielen. Auf den Rängen hätte man wahrscheinlich weniger Nervenkitzel vertragen ;-) Aufgrund des besseren Spielverhältnisses bleibt der Askö Traun weiter Tabellenführer. Am Vortag kam unser Team gegen Ohlsdorf zu einem 5:3 Erfolg. Die Spiele, die an den Aufsteiger gingen, wurden erst im 3. Satz verloren.</p><p><em>BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven</em> (aus dem Pressebericht) (Platz 3 der Tabelle)<br>Mit einer 2:6 Niederlage gegen den Vorjahresmeister Union Feldkirch startete das Alkovener Team am Wochenende ersatzgeschwächt in die Doppelrunde der 2.Badminton-Bundesliga. Im 2.Spiel gab es dann aber auswärts gegen Union Vorchdorf einen 6:2 Sieg.<br>Leider fehlten im ersten Spiel in der TH Alkoven mit Christoph Lessl und Thomas Hahn gleich 2 Stammspieler. Dadurch waren einige Umstellungen notwendig, noch dazu fehlte das Glück zu einem besseren Ergebnis. Die beiden Jugendspieler Lukas Mittermayr und Michael Scheinecker erlebten ihren ersten Auftritt im Bundesligateam.<br>Einen Punkt sicherte Lukas Rebhandl im Spitzenspiel gegen Fabian Steurer, er gewann sein Match in 3 Sätzen. Den zweiten Sieg holte das Damendoppel Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann. 2 Matchbälle vergaben die Brüder Lukas und Simon Rebhandl im 1.Herrendoppel, ehe sie nach Verlängerung im 3.Satz mit 23:25 unterlagen. Auch im Einzel spielte Simon Rebhandl glücklos, sein Spiel ging ebenfalls im 3.Satz verloren. In den restlichen Spielen waren die Gäste aus dem Ländle stärker und damit am Ende auch mit 6:2 erfolgreich.<br>Im OÖ-Derby in Vorchdorf stand Thomas Hahn wieder  zur Verfügung und damit präsentierte sich das Alkovener Team wieder mit einer starken Besetzung. Beide Mannschaften standen vor Spielbeginn in einer von Vandalen verwüsteten Sporthalle, die Polizei rückte zur Spurensicherung an.<br>Bereits in den Doppelspielen wurde der Grundstein zum Erfolg gelegt. Thomas Hahn/Simon Rebhandl, Harald Hochgatterer/Lukas Rebhandl und Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann stellten auf 3:0. Dann spielte auch noch Lukas Rebhandl groß auf und schlug den Vorchdorfer Legionär Primoz Fils ganz knapp im 3.Satz. Für den Endstand von 6:2 sorgten Harald Hochgatterer und das Mixed Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl.<br>Wegen einiger Individualturniere gibt es das nächste Bundesligaspiel erst am 29.11. – Alkoven empfängt den Tabellenletzten WBH Wien.</p><p><em>Union Ohlsdorf</em> (aus dem Pressebericht) (Platz 4 der Tabelle)<br>Ein Unentschieden gegen Traun wäre schon eine kleine Sensation gewesen. Die Herrendoppel und die Einzel von Jürgen Koch und Jakob Ostermann gingen auch klar an Traun. Doch der wieder genesene Wimmer Thomas, das Doppel Haas/Hochmeir und das Mix Baumgartner/Fröhlich brachten noch drei Spiele für uns. Maria Fröhlich kämpfte im Dameneinzel zwar beherzt, musste sich aber knapp Barbara Gallos geschlagen geben.<br>Gegen Wien waren eigentlich zwei Punkte eingeplant, aber mit Nervosität und Krampf gelang leider nur ein Unentschieden. Für diese Musssiege fehlt leider noch etwas die Routine. Da müssen wir noch hart daran arbeiten. </p><p><em>UBC Vorchdorf </em>(aus dem Pressebericht) (Platz 5 der Tabelle)<br>Mit einem 5:3-Auswärtssieg bei WBH Wien startete UBC Vorchdorf in die Doppelrunde. Im Heimspiel gegen BC Alkoven kam mit der 2:6 Niederlage die Ernüchterung. Bereits vor Spielbeginn verwüsteten in der Nacht Vandalen die Sporthalle Vorchdorf.<br>In Topbesetzung konnten die Vorchdorfer auswärts gegen Wien antreten. Die neuformierten Doppel brachten auch gleich einen Sieg von Primos Flis / Dominik Kronsteiner, während Günter Kofler / Erik Seiwald knapp unterlagen. Souverän die UBC-Damen: Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi siegten mit 2:0 Sätzen. Im Topeinzel spielte Primos Flis groß auf und besiegte Jun Mai in 3 Sätzen. Ebenfalls mit 2:1 Sätzen konnte Günter Kofler siegreich bleiben. Den Siegpunkt erzielte Miriam Gruber mit einem 21:14, 21:15 Sieg über Delueg.<br>Schock dann für das UBC Team am 2. Spieltag. Als das Team die Sporthalle zur Matinee gegen Alkoven betrat, erlebten sie eine von Vandalen verwüstete Sporthalle. „Das war kein Bubenstreich,“ zeigte sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl tiefst geschockt. Die Polizei konnte Spuren sicherstellen. Nachdem die Halle wieder spielbereit gemacht wurde, erlebten die Heimischen einen regelrechten Fehlstart. Alle drei Doppel gingen verloren, zwei in drei Sätzen. Im Topeinzel musste sich diesmal Primos Flis mit 19:21 im dritten Satz gegen Rebhandl geschlagen geben. Mit Siegen von Erik Seiwald und Miriam Gruber konnten die Vorchdorfer noch kurz aufholen, ehe Garsleitner und Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi ihre Spiele zur 2:6 Niederlage verloren. Insgesamt gingen alle vier Dreisatzpartien an die Gäste. „Ein Unentschieden wäre verdient gewesen, aber heute lief von Beginn an alles gegen uns,“ zeigte sich Harald Starl nach dem Spiel enttäuscht.<br>Durch die nationalen Individualturniere in den nächsten Wochen wird die Bundesliga erst wieder Ende November fortgesetzt – mit dem Auswärtsspiel von UBC Vorchdorf beim Tabellenführer Traun.   </p>","2014-10-27","/content/news/Bundesliga-Doppelrunde-Verwuestete-Halle-und-keine-zwei-Siege-fuer-eine-ooe-Mannschaft/5b9e48de22c38.png","4");

Am 25./26. Oktober gastieren in Linz, AHS Solar City zwei Top Bundesligavereine. „Die Mödlinger, die schon in der vergangenen Saison toll aufspielten aber sich im Halbfinal-Play-off gegen den BSC 70 Linz geschlagen geben mussten, werden in dieser Saison alles daran setzen in das Finale einzuziehen. Damit ist klar, dass sie dieses Wochenende stark aufspielen werden und es wird daher das TOP-Spiel der 2. Runde.<br>Am Sonntag empfangen wir die Wolfurter, die sich gegenüber der letzten Saison verstärkt haben und in der 1. Runde dem aktuellen Mannschaftsstaatsmeister Wien einen Unentschieden abverlangt hatten.<br>Auch dieses Match wird im Richtung Play-off-Beteiligung beider Teams sehr wichtig sein und wir erwarten ein ebenfalls enges Match. Die Frage ist auch wie wir das Match vom Vortag aus den Knochen bekommen.“ erwartet Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger ein spannendes Bundesligawochenende.</p><p><strong>UBC Vorchdorf: </strong>Zuerst muss UBC Vorchdorf am Samstag, 25. Okt. 2014 in Wien gegen WBH antreten, ehe es am Sonntag, 26. Okt. 2014 um 10 Uhr in der eigenen Halle gegen BC Alkoven geht. Die bevorstehende Doppelrunde wird für UBC Vorchdorf richtungsweisend sein. Können die Vorchdorf punkten, so kann man sich nach oben orientieren – sollte das Wochenende erfolglos bleiben, so steht das UBC Team im unmittelbaren Abstiegskampf. Nach der unglücklichen Auftaktniederlage in Feldkirch hoffen die Vorchdorfer ihr stärkstes Team stellen zu können. Besonders gegen Wien ist ein Punktegewinn beinah ein Muss. </p>","2014-10-23","/content/news/Bundesliga-Doppelrunde-am-Wochenende-In-OOE-sind-6-Bundesliga-Spiele-zu-sehen/5b9e49006eb2e.png","5");

Vereine in der 1. und 2. Bundesliga in der ersten Runde.</p><p><strong>1. Bundesliga</strong> (Bericht: BSC 70 Linz)<br>Gestern startete der Askö BSC 70 Linz – 5 Monate nach dem Vize-Staatsmeistertitel – in die neue Bundesligasaison. Gegen ASV Presbaum musste man auswärts einen guten Start hinlegen um in 14 Tagen gegen Halbfinalgegner Mödling und Wolfurt gut vorbereitet zu sein. Am 25./26.10.14 folgen die nächsten Runden der Bundesliga und den Heimspielen in der Linzer Solar City Halle.<br>Nach einer komfortablen 3:0 Führung nach den 3 Doppelspielen ist in Pressbaum jedoch kein Spiel zu Ende. Auch wenn man das Gefühl hatte, es brennt nichts mehr an, zeigten die letzten Jahre, dass die Pressbaumer niemals zu unterschätzen sind und das taten wir auch am 1. Spieltag dieser Saison nicht. Im 1. Einzel zwischen Peyo Boychinov und Miha Sepec sah man, dass beide in der letzten Saison noch gemeinsam im Team spielten. Jeder kannte die Stärken und Schwächen des Gegners und so war es ein sehr taktisches Spiel das am Ende vom Neu-Pressbaumer Peyo Bochinov, knapp aber doch, gewonnen wurde. Miha unterliefen im der entscheiden Phase zu viele Fehler und er musste sich mit 19:21 20:22 beugen. Im 2. Einzel kam es zu Rüdiger Gnedts Debüt im BSC 70 Linz. Dass seine Vorbereitung nach Knieproblemen erst im August beginnen konnte sah man am 1. Spieltag sehr deutlich. Viel zu schwerfällig spielte Rüdiger Gnedt an diesem Tag und musste sich mit 21:19, 21:16 gegen Ralph Bittenauer geschlagen geben. Wolfgang Gnedt, ebenfalls im Debütspiel der Bundesliga für den BSC 70 Linz, konnte eine gute Leistung zeigen. Der 17-Jährige zeigte ein souveränes Spiel ohne viel Fehler und sorgte für den zwischenzeitlichen 4. Punkt im Spiel. Er gewann 21:18 21:13 gegen Markus Schaller. Durch den verletzungsbedingten Ausfall von Sarina Kohlfürst musste Nika Koncut gegen Sonja Langthaler antreten. Nika spielte ein souveränes, sicheres und taktisch ausgezeichnetes Spiel und holte mit 21:18 21:12 den 5. Siegespunkt für das Team. Im abschließenden Mixed Doppel ließen Miha und Natalia nur 1. Satz lang das Spiel dem Gegner machen; schlussendlich gewann sie in 3 Sätzen (21:15 13:21 21:9) und fixierten den 6:2 Auswärtssieg in Pressbaum.<br>Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger nach dem Spiel: „ein guter Auftakt in die Saison ist immer wichtig um die Ruhe in der Mannschaft zu halten. Heute war es nicht ganz so einfach, weil einige Spieler in der vergangenen Saison noch im anderen Team spielten. Schlussendlich zählt nur der Erfolg. Nach dem ersten Spiel sieht man wo man steht und welche Spieler weiter und hart an sich arbeiten müssen. Dass Daniel Walchshofer und Sarina Kohlfürst – beide sind verletzt – mit nach Pressbaum gekommen sind, zeigt, dass das Team GEMEINSAM auch in diesem Jahr an den Erfolg der letzten Saison anknüpfen möchte. Auch wenn kein Spieleinsatz möglich war, wollten sie das Team unterstützen.“</p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga</strong><br><em>Traun startet mit deutlichem 7:1</em><br>Der ASKÖ Traun startet mit Rückkehrer Jürgen Koch und gewinnt deutlich 7:1 zuhause gegen WBH Wien II.</p><p><em>Ohlsdorf und Alkoven trennen sich im Derby einvernehmlich</em><br>Bericht Gastgeber Union Ohlsdorf: Rund 80 Zuseher waren in die Laakirchner Sporthalle gekommen um unsere Ohlsdorfer Mannschaft bei ihrem Bundesligaauftakt zu unterstützen und sie sahen eine spannende und ausgeglichene Begegnung. Zum Auftakt gingen gleich beide Herrendoppel über drei Sätze, wobei sich Berger/Serov dann doch klar durchsetzten, hingegen Baumgartner/Fröhlich knapp verloren. Das Damendoppel schien zunächst aussichtslos für Ohlsdorf, doch Reiter/Haas lieferten einen großen Kampf, mussten sich dann aber doch der Routine von Freimüller/Steinmann geschlagen geben. Die Herreneinzel gingen durch Serov und Baumgartner an Ohlsdorf bzw. Rebhandl Lukas an Alkoven. Nach einem hart erkämpften Dreisatzsieg von Maria Fröhlich gegen Maria Steinmann stand es 4:3 für Ohlsdorf. Vor dem Mixdoppel rechneten alle schon mit einem klaren Sieg von Simon Rebhand/Iris Freimüller, doch Michael Schausberger und Jana Haas wuchsen über sich hinaus und lieferten ein großartiges Spiel. Der erste Satz ging mit 25:23 an Alkoven und auch der zweite Satz wurde von den jungen Ohlsdorfern nur mit 18:21 verloren. Besonders dieses letzte Spiel war eine tolle Werbung für den Badmintonsport in unserer Region und mit dem Unentschieden waren letztendlich alle zufrieden.<br>Bericht Alkoven: Spannende und hochklassige Spiele erlebten die Zuschauer in der Laakirchner Sporthalle beim Saisonauftakt in der Badminton-Bundesliga. Gastgeber Union Ohlsdorf und der BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven trennten sich am Ende mit einem gerechten 4:4 Unentschieden. Lukas Rebhandl ließ in seinem Einzel dem Routinier Manuel Berger keine Chance und siegte klar in 2 Sätzen. Gemeinsam mit dem Teamneuling Harald Hochgatterer gewann er auch das Doppel. Taktisch bestens eingestellt konnten die beiden die stark spielenden Kontrahenten Fröhlich/Baumgartner knapp mit 21:18 im 3.Satz bezwingen. Die beiden anderen Punkte steuerte Iris Freimüller mit ihren Partnern bei. Im Damendoppel siegte sie an der Seite von Maria Steinmann sicher in 2 Sätzen. Mehr als erwartet musste Freimüller im abschließenden Mixed mit ihrem Partner Simon Rebhandl kämpfen. Die jungen Gegner Schausberger/Haas verlangten dem schon lange erfolgreichen Alkovener Mixed alles ab. Die beiden Routiniers konnten die Partie aber dann doch in 2 Sätzen beenden und somit den Endstand von 4:4 herstellen.</p><p><em>Vorchdorf reaktiviert Kronsteiner und verliert trotz gutem Spiel im Ländle</em><br>Bericht Vorchdorf: Schade! Mit einer äußerst unglücklichen 3 : 5 Auswärtsniederlage bei Meister Feldkirch startete das neuformierte UBC-Team in die neue Saison. Dominik Kronsteiner gab nach exakt 36 Wochen Verletzungspause sein Comeback. Überraschend die Aufstellung von Vorchdorf, denn Dominik Kronsteiner spielte 36 Wochen nach seinem Achillessehnenriss im Doppel und brachte mit Manuel Weber sein Team mit einem klaren Zweisatzsieg in Front. Bei den beiden Neuerwerbungen Primoz Flis und Erik Seiwald merkte man noch Abstimmungsprobleme – sie verloren mit 0 : 2 das Topdoppel. Das Damendoppel war wohl eines der besten Spiele in den letzten Jahren. Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi setzten sich mit 2 : 1 durch und brachten Vorchdorf erneut in Führung. Während Primoz Flis das Topeinzel knapp in drei Sätzen verlor, feierte Erik Seiwald nach Aufholjagd im zweiten Satz einen 21:16 23:21 Sieg über den höher eingeschätzten Giesinger. Florian Brandstötter kämpfte zwar verbissen, er unterlag jedoch in 3 Sätzen gegen Routinier Isopp. Auf dem Weg zu alter Stärke scheint Miriam Gruber zu sein. Die Ex-Staatsmeisterin unterlag gegen Nationalspielerin Ziesig nur mit 18:21 17:21. Nach dem klaren Gewinn des 1. Satzes im Mixed von Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi rechneten schon alle mit einem Unentschieden. Doch wie aus heiterem Himmel riss der Faden im Spiel der Vorchdorfer und sie mussten sich in 3 Sätzen geschlagen geben. Damit stand das UBC mit der 3 : 5 Niederlage mit leeren Händen da. „Wir waren so lange auf gutem Weg, aus dem Ländle einen Punkt zu entführen,“ trauert UBC Obmann Harald Starl der großen Chance nach. Aber: „Erfreulich ist das gelungene Comeback von Dominik Kronsteiner,“  freut sich Starl auf ein komplettes Team in den nächsten Runden.</p><p>Foto: Ohlsdorf</p>","2014-10-12","/content/news/Die-Bundesliga-Ergebnisse-Ohlsdorf-und-Alkoven-trennen-sich-zum-Auftakt-mit-einem-Unentschieden/5b9e49e6489a0.png","7");

Zuerst wie immer zur 1.<br>Landesliga. Nach dem Aufstieg von Union Ohlsdorf in die 2. Bundesliga, die am kommenden Wochenende startet, wird in OÖ ein neuer Mannschaftslandesmeister gesucht. Als ersten Favorit auf den Titel muss man hier den BSC 70 Linz nennen, der ja quasi Absteiger aus der 2. Bundesliga ist, auch wenn die 2. Bundesliga Mannschaft aufgelöst wurde. Nach Runde 1 sind sie auch Tabellenführer, in wie weit sie den Titel erreichen können wird wohl vor allem gegen die beiden Windischgarstner Vereine entschieden.<br>Die Überraschung Union Kirchdorf 1 des Vorjahres, die lange Zeit weit vorne in der Tabelle zu finden war, könnte aber hier durchaus ein unangenehmer Gegner für alle 3 Favoriten werden, da sie trotz des Abgangs von Steffi Peter nach Wien eine sehr ausgeglichene Mannschaft stellen. Aber auch die Aufsteiger Union Urfahr und UBC Neuhofen können durchaus die oben genannten „Papierfavoriten“ durchaus ärgern. Die nächsten Runden werden es zeigen, wie sich der Kampf um den Titel in der 1. Landesliga entwickelt.</p><p>Lobenswert ist, dass es diese Saison in der ersten Runde nur eine W.O. Partie gegeben hat. Dies war in der Bezirksliga Nord der Fall, wo Andorf daher zu einem klaren 8:0 Sieg kam. In den restlichen Ligen und Klassen kann noch wenig erkannt werden, da viele Spiele entweder knapp entschieden wurden oder gar unentschieden endeten. In den nächsten Runden werden aber auch hier Tendenzen erkennbar werden.  Dann werde ich mich auch genauer mit den einzelnen Ligen und Klassen beschäftigen.</p><p>Auch lobenswert zu erwähnen ist, dass die Vereine bzw. die Verantwortlichen diesmal Spielerranglisten abgegeben haben, die vom Ligagremium in keinem Fall beanstandet wurden. Das zeigt für mich, dass die Einführung des Gremiums einen positiven Einfluss auf die Vereine hatte. Bis dann … nach Runde 2. </p><p>Euer Klaus Mitterhauser</p>","2014-10-09","/content/news/Aus-den-Ligen-geplaudert-hellip-nach-Runde-1/5b9e4a5533c4c.png","6");

Mit Wolfgang & Rüdiger Gnedt hat das Team junge, starke Verstärkung.</p><p>Wie immer gilt es für alle Teams, den amtierenden Mannschaftsmeister vom Thron stürzen! Der Meister (WBH Wien) der vergangenen Saison ist, auch mit leicht geänderter Mannschaft, noch immer Favorit. Dahinter ist wohl Badminton Mödling die heißeste Aktie um den Meistertitel 2014/2015 – In Summe sind wohl alle Teams leistungsmäßig näher zusammengerückt, was überaus spannende Begegnungen verspricht.</p><p>Die Mannschaft des BSC 70 Linz geht mit kleinen Änderungen in die neue Saison. Peyo Bochinov, letzte Saison noch Nr. 1 im Einzel, wird in dieser Saison beim Auftakt für den ASV Pressbaum aufschlagen. Auch Mixed-Spezialist Vladimir Metotiev wechselte innerhalb der Bundesliga zum Finalgegner WBH Wien.</p><p>Dafür setzt der BSC 70 Linz ab der kommenden Saison auf die österreichische Jugend. Mit Wolfgang Gnedt steht ein sehr aktiver und der derzeit beste Nachwuchsspieler in seiner Altersklasse im Team des BSC 70 Linz. Zuletzt konnte er 2 internationale Jungendturniere gewinnen (wir berichteten) und war bei der Jugend-Olympiade. Gemeinsam mit Bruder Rüdiger Gnedt werden beide den BSC 70 Linz verstärken. Beide spielten vergangene Saison noch in der Bundesliga für Pressbaum.</p><p>„Wir haben eine sehr ausgeglichene, international erfahrene Mannschaft – Ziel ist es auch heuer wieder in das Meister-Play-off der besten 4 Teams einzuziehen; ein gutes Auftaktergebnis gegen ASV Pressbaum wäre wünschenswert für uns.“ kommentiert Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger den Saisonstart.</p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga</strong><br>Union Ohlsdorf, BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven, UBC Vorchdorf, ASKÖ Traun – die Dichte an Mannschaften der 2. Bundesliga ist in OÖ groß.</p><p>Das in dieser Saison in jeder Runde vorkommende oö. Derby bestreiten als erste <strong>Union Ohlsdorf und BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven (11.10.2014, 14:00 Sporthalle Laakirchen).</strong></p><p>Der 12fache österreichische Mannschaftsmeister <strong>ASKÖ Traun</strong> startet ebenfalls am kommenden Wochenende (11.10.2014, 17:00, Haka Arena) gegen WBH Wien II in die Saison. Nach der Rückkehr von Serienstaatsmeister Jürgen Koch (er spielte 3 Jahre in der deutschen Bundesliga) sind die Aussichten auf einen Spitzenplatz heuer sehr gut. Mit seinem langjährigen Doppelpartner Peter Zauner bildet er den Kern der Trauner Mannschaft. Der weitere Kader für die Saison 2014/15 setzt sich zusammen aus Alexander Serov, Klaus Dornig, Jakob Ostermann, Markus Ratzenböck und Alex Wong sowie bei den Damen Barbara Galos, Barbara Scheer, Laura Hauser und Lena Zinganell. Sektionsleiter Herbert Koch vor dem Spiel optimistisch: „Mit einer guten Mischung aus routinierten und jungen Sportlerinnen und Sportlern ist unsere Mannschaft sicher stärker als in der letzten Saison. Das Team um die beiden Routiniers wird durch einige Nachwuchskräfte ergänzt. Alexander Serov ist ebenso in die Reihen der ASKÖ Traun zurückgekehrt. Als Ziel für die Hinrunde nehmen wir uns einen Platz in den TOP 3 vor. Sollte sich bis Dezember das Leistungsniveau der Mannschaft entsprechend entwickeln, ist eine Weichenstellung in Richtung Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga durchaus denkbar. Dazu wäre allerdings internationale Verstärkung auf der einen oder anderen Position erforderlich. Wir gehen mit Optimismus in die kommende Saison.“</p><p>Mit dem Auswärtsspiel in Feldkirch startet <strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong> am Samstag, 11. Okt. 2014 in die 21. Bundesligasaison ihrer Vereinsgeschichte. Nach dem 3. Platz in der letzten Saison haben die Vorchdorfer dennoch „nur“ den Klassenerhalt als Ziel ausgegeben. „Es wird eine schwierige Saison,“ rechnet UBC Obmann Harald Starl mit den Kampf um den Klassenerhalt und vielen Unbekannten. So fehlt Teamleader Dominik Kronsteiner nach seinem Achillessehnenriss zu Beginn und auch Günter Kofler wird auf Grund beruflicher Veränderung nur teilweise dem Team zur Verfügung stehen. Zu Ende ging auch die Kooperation mit der UNION Ohlsdorf, da der Lokalrivale selbst den Aufstieg in die 2. Bundesliga schaffte. Neu im UBC Team stehen drei junge Akteure: Aus Slowenien kam der 22-jährige Primoz Flis, der die Saison als Nummer eins bestreiten wird. Mit Erik Seiwald und Martina Nöst holte UBC Vorchdorf zwei junge Steirer ins Team. „Wir haben junge hoffnungsvolle Spieler geholt!“ so Starl. Den Kader des UBC Vorchdorf vervollständigen Manuel Weber, Florian Brandstötter, Christian Putz, Markus Garsleitner sowie die Damen Miriam Gruber und Zita Banhegyi.</p><p>Bericht: BSC 70 Linz, UBC Vorchdorf</p>","2014-10-09","/content/news/Die-Bundesliga-startet-in-die-Saison/5b9e4a91bc9ac.png","5");

Platz in der Tabelle und Kontakt zur Tabellenspitze, Traun liegt nach der Hinrunde davor auf Platz 2 hinter Leader Feldkirch. Die Rückrunde verspricht damit noch viel Spannung.</p><p>Nach dem hartumkämpften 4 : 4 im Derby zwischen UNION Ohlsdorf und UBC Vorchdorf gab es zufriedene Gesichter in beiden Lagern. In der Tabelle bleibt Vorchdorf knapp vor den Ohlsdorfern.<br>Ein Spiel auf Augenhöhe prophezeite UBC Obmann Harald Starl vor Beginn. Und er sollte Recht behalten. Von Beginn an wechselte die Führung andauernd – und letztendlich waren alle mit dem Unentschieden zufrieden. Ohlsdorf ging nach den beiden Herrendoppel mit 2:0 in Führung. Danach brachten klare Siege von Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi und Primoz Flis den Gleichstand. Ausgerechnet Ex-UBC Spieler Thomas Wimmer vermasselte seinen Ex-Klub die Party: Nach seinem Sieg im Doppel konnte er nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten Erik Seiwald in drei Sätzen bezwingen. Der Ausgleich gelang Miriam Gruber. Die Ex-Staatsmeisterin im UBC-Dress behielt gegen Youngster Katharina Hochmeir in zwei Sätzen die Oberhand. Nach dem Gewinn des 3. Herreneinzels durch Lukas Fröhlich standen die Gäste aus Vorchdorf vor dem abschließenden Mixed unter Druck. Doch Dank ihrer Routine und Nervenstärke sicherten Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi mit 21:11, 27:25 den vierten Punkt für Vorchdorf und das verdiente Unentschieden.</p>","2014-12-18","/content/news/Ein-bdquounentschiedenesldquo-Bundesliga-Wochenende/5b9e4c9a39afa.png","4");

Bundesliga</strong><br>(aus dem Bericht des BSC 70 Linz)<br>Niederlage beim Tabellenführer Mödling (2:6) und beim direkten Rivalen um den Playoff-Platz Klagenfurt (3:5): Am Samstag musste man in Mödling antreten, sonntags ging es dann noch nach Klagenfurt zum entscheidenden Spiel um den 4. Platz im Grunddurchgang. Klagenfurt, auswärts, musste besiegt werden um noch die Chance auf das Halbfinale zu wahren. Leider waren die Vorzeichen alles andere als rosig. Mit Daniel Walchshofer, Kek Jamnik und Sarina Kohlfürst sind aktuell 3 Spieler des Teams verletzt. Bei den entscheidenden Spielen natürlich ein herber Rückschlag. Leider starteten wir sehr schlecht in die Partie – schon nach den Doppelspielen stand es 3:0 für die Gastgeber aus Klagenfurt.<br>Mannschaftsführer Christoph Kainrath nach dem Spiel: „dem Team war die Enttäuschung nach dem heutigen Spiel deutlich anzusehen. Leider ist jetzt, realistischer Weise, der Zug für das Bundesliga-Halbfinale abgefahren. Jetzt gilt es sich neu zu fokussieren um für die neuen Aufgaben bestmöglich gerüstet zu sein. Nun geht es für das Team um den Verbleib in der 1. Liga“. Bleibt nur zu hoffen, dass die verletzten Spieler zumindest bis zu den Play-off Spielen wieder fit sind.</p><p><strong>2. Bundesliga</strong><br>Der ASKÖ Traun siegt gegen den BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven, spielt aber am zweiten Tag gegen Vorchdorf nur unentschieden. Die Zeichen für das mittlere Playoff der besten zwei der zweiten Bundesliga mit den hinteren zwei der ersten Bundesliga stehen also gut. Ohlsdorf kann mit einem Unentschieden gegen Leader Feldkirch den Klassenerhalt (fast sicher) sichern.</p><p><em><strong>Nach Traumcomeback – Liga gesichert</strong></em><br>(aus dem Bericht des UBC Vorchdorf)<br>Mit dem Sieg im Derby gegen Ohlsdorf (5:3) und dem Unentschieden gegen Traun (4:4) hat UBC Vorchdorf vorzeitig den Klassenerhalt in der 2. Badminton Bundesliga gesichert. Mitverantwortlich war das Einzelcomeback von Dominik Kronsteiner.<br>Eigentlich schon standardgemäß verlief der Start gegen Ohlsdorf für die Heimischen. Nach zwei klaren Doppelniederlagen lag das UBC-Team rasch mit 0:2 im Rückstand. Und auch Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi hatten einen holprigen Start, ehe sie sich in drei Sätzen durchsetzen konnten.<br>Primoz Flis erspielte einen souveränen Sieg im Topeinzel und Vorchdorf war wieder im Rennen. Während Erik Seiwald eine bittere Niederlage einstecken musste, gelang Miriam Gruber durch einen 22:20 21:14 Sieg über die neue Landesmeisterin Katharina Hochmeier abermals der Ausgleich. Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi brachten mit ihren Sieg im Mixed den UBC Vorchdorf  erstmals in Führung.<br>Exakt vor einem Jahr riss sich Dominik Kronsteiner die Achillessehne – bei seinem Einzelcomeback wurde er zum großen Matchwinner. Nach knapp gewonnen 1. Satz und Verlust des 2. Satzes musste ein Entscheidungssatz her. Und Kronsteiner spielte all seine Routine aus und siegte mit 21:14 – gleichbedeutend mit dem 5:3-Sieg.<br>„Ein Sieg im Derby tut immer gut,“ freute sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl über den letztlich doch glücklichen Sieg. „Mehr noch freut mich das gelungene Einzelcomeback von Kronsteiner.“<br>Teil 2 der Doppelrunde begann für das UBC Team gegen Traun ebenso wie gewohnt, nachdem beide Herrendoppel verloren gingen. Dann begann wieder die Aufholjagd durch Siege von Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi und dem Einzelsieg von Primoz Flis. Noch einmal ging Traun durch Ex-Staatsmeister Peter Zauner nach Sieg über Erik Seiwald in Führung. Und wieder glich Miriam Gruber mit klarem Zweisatzsieg aus. Auch bei seinem zweitem Einzel nach seiner Verletzung zeigte Dominik Kronsteiner groß auf – diesmal besiegte er Ostermann nach hartumkämpften drei Sätzen und Vorchdorf führte mit 4:3. Erstmals in der Vorchdorfer Bundesligageschichte war ein Sieg über den Rekordmeister aus Traun möglich. Doch es wollte nicht sein: nach einem spannenden Mixed hatten letztlich die Gäste gegen Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi das glücklichere Ende und siegten mit 14:21 25:23 21:19.<br>„Es ist wie verhext gegen Traun,“ ärgerte sich Starl nur kurz, „denn die drei Punkte aus der Doppelrunde und der vorzeitigen Klassenerhalt sind Grund zur Freude.“<br>In zwei Wochen (7. Februar 2015) empfängt UBC Vorchdorf Tabellenführer BC Feldkirch.</p><p><strong><br><em>Ein anstrengendes Wochenende mit Niederlage und Sieg</em></strong><br>(aus dem Bericht des BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven)<br>„An diesem Wochenende erlebten wir zwei total unterschiedliche Spiele. Während gegen Traun nichts zusammenlief, bot unser Team eine großartige kämpferische Leistung gegen eine sehr starke Wiener Mannschaft. Letztendlich sind wir mit 2 Punkten aber zufrieden und bleiben an der Spitze dran.“<br>Zwei anstrengende Auswärtspartien hatte das Alkovener Badmintonteam am Wochenende zu bestreiten. Schwer tat sich die Mannschaft am Samstag gegen den österreichischen Rekordmeister ASKÖ Traun (2:6). Nach den Doppelspielen führten die Trauner bereits 3:0, dann mussten sich auch Lukas Rebhandl und Maria Steinmann knapp in 3 Sätzen geschlagen geben. Damit war die Niederlage besiegelt. Die beiden Punkte holten Harald Hochgatterer im HE3 und das Mixed Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl.<br>Die Reise am Sonntag ging in die Bundeshauptstadt zum Spiel gegen WBH Wien II. Hoch motiviert ging das Alkovener Team in das Spiel und legte mit den Siegen in den beiden Herrendoppeln den Grundstein zum Erfolg. Simon Rebhandl/Thomas Hahn und Christoph Lessl/Lukas Rebhandl boten Topleistungen und brachten die Mannschaft mit 2:0 in Führung. Dann musste sich aber das Damendoppel Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann überraschend geschlagen geben. Mit einer großartigen kämpferischen Leistung in ihren Einzelmatches erhöhten Lukas Rebhandl und Thomas Hahn auf 4:1. Die Wiener ließen aber nicht locker und stellten auf 4:3. Damit musste, wie schon so oft, die Entscheidung im Mixed fallen. Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl taten sich zwar schwer, feierten am Ende aber einen hart erkämpften Sieg in 3 Sätzen und fixierten damit den 5:3 Erfolg.<br>Da auch die direkten Gegner an diesem Wochenende Punkte liegen ließen, bleibt der BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven auf Platz 3 in der Tabelle.</p>","2015-01-23","/content/news/BSC-70-Linz-verliert-im-direkten-Duell-um-das-Meister-Playoff-Vorchdorf-sichert-Klassenerhalt-auch-Ohlsdorf-fast-sicher-durch/5b9e4d9f1cec5.png","4");

Bundesliga – Endlich wieder ein Erfolg in der Badminton Bundesliga für den Cracks des BSC 70 Linz: Man gewinnt gegen ASV Pressbaum mit 5:3</strong><br>Mit einem Sieg startet der Askö BSC 70 Linz in die Bundesliga Rückrunde. Ein wiederum schweres Spiel für unser Team in der Rückrunde der Bundesliga stand am Programm. 2 Ausfälle hatte das Team zu verkraften. Rüdiger Gnedt (Verletzung) und Sarina Kohlfürst (Grippe) mussten die Partie passen.<br>Diesmal stand es nach den Doppelspielen 2:1 für uns; in der Hoffnung irgendwie die für uns wichtigen 5 Punkte zu holen musste auch bei den Einzelspielen einiges funktionieren. Ein Sieg musste erreicht werden um die Hoffnungen auf das Meister-Play-off Halbfinale noch selbst in der Hand zu haben.<br>Im 1. Einzel zwischen Peyo Boychinov und Miha Sepec sah man erneut, dass beide in der letzten Saison noch gemeinsam im Team spielten. Jeder kannte die Stärken und Schwächen des Gegners und so war es ein sehr taktisches Spiel, das am Ende wieder vom Pressbaumer Peyo Bochinov, knapp aber doch, gewonnen wurde. Miha unterliefen in der entscheiden Phasen, vor allem im 2. Satz, zu viele Fehler und musste sich mit 21-19 17-21 13-21 beugen. Im 2. Einzel kam es für den 17-jährigen Wolfgang Gnedt zum Debüt auf dieser Position. Ein enges Match gegen Stefan Ratheyer war angesagt. Sehenswerte Ballwechsel boten die beiden und Wolfgang wurde an den Rand einer Niederlage gedrängt. Ratheyer hatte sogar Matchball und mit einem Sieg wären die Siegchancen an diesem Tag auf null gesunken. Schlussendlich konnte Wolfgang den 2. Satz noch mit 23-21 gewinnen und ließ im 3. Satz, auch dank seiner Konditionsstärke, nichts mehr anbrennen und gewann 21-11. Im 3. Einzel kam Daniel Walchshofer zu seinem Einsatz. Gegen Ralph Bittenauer konnte er die Partie lange offen gestalten, musste in den entscheidenden Phasen der Sätze leider die Überlegenheit des Gegners akzeptieren. Dennoch ein gutes Spiel von Daniel, der auch in Zukunft auf Einsätze in der Bundesliga hoffen darf.<br>Durch den krankheitsbedingten Ausfall von Sarina Kohlfürst musste Nika Koncut gegen Sonja Langthaler antreten. Nika, emotional wie immer, hatte diesmal erhebliche Probleme mit dem Spiel von Sonja. Im zweiten Satz musste sie sogar einem 12-18 Rückstand nachlaufen. Das Spiel stand auf Messers Schneide, aber Nika konnte in dieser entscheidenden Phase einen ruhigen Kopf bewahren und siegte im 2. Satz noch 21-19. Im dritten Satz war die Moral von Sonja Langthaler gebrochen und Nika gewann mit 21-9 und holte den ganz wichtigen 4. Siegespunkt für das Team. Im abschließenden Mixed Doppel ließen Miha und Natalia nur nach der Pause im 2. Satz etwas nach; schlussendlich gewannen sie ohne wirklich glänzen zu müssen mit (21-10 21-18) und fixierten den 5:3 Heimsieg.<br>Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger nach dem Spiel: „hoffentlich kommt jetzt wieder etwas Ruhe in die Mannschaft. Heute war viel Kampf und Krampf dabei, aber das Team hat toll zusammengehalten und den wichtigen Sieg in Richtung Halbfinale eingefahren.“ [BSC 70 Linz]</p><p><em><strong>2. Bundesliga</strong></em></p><p><strong>BC Schweiger Sport Alkoven : Union Vorchdorf   5:3</strong><br>Der Kampf der beiden Tabellennachbarn verlief ganz nach dem Geschmack des Publikums. Tolle Ballwechsel und spannende Spiele prägten das Match, letztendlich hatten die Gastgeber aus Alkoven die besseren Nerven und siegten zwar knapp, aber verdient mit 5:3. Mit den beiden Siegen der Herrendoppel Simon Rebhandl/Thomas Hahn und Lukas Rebhandl/Harald Hochgatterer wurde der Grundstein zum Erfolg gelegt. Dann bot Lukas Rebhandl im Topspiel gegen den slowenischen Legionär Primos Fils eine Spitzenleistung und brachte sein Team mit 3:0 in Führung. Vorchdorf setzte aber dagegen und konnte sogar auf 3:3 ausgleichen. Die beiden abschließenden Partien wurden dann jeweils erst im 3. Satz entschieden. Christoph Lessl und das bereits oft bewährte Mixed Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl konnten sich mit starkem Spiel und Nervenstärke durchsetzen und so den Sieg fixieren. Der BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven hält mit diesem Erfolg weiterhin Kontakt zur Tabellenspitze und liegt weiterhin punktegleich mit Traun auf Platz 3 [BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven].<br>Gegen den unmittelbaren Tabellennachbarn aus Alkoven startete UBC Vorchdorf wie zuletzt mit zwei Niederlagen in den Doppelbegegnungen. Im Damendoppel zeigten Miriam Gruber und Zita Banhegyi Nerven – wehrten im 1. Satz 8 Satzbälle ab, ehe sie mit 30:28, 21:18 gewinnen konnten. Im Topeinzel musste sich Primos Flis abermals gegen Rebhandl geschlagen geben. Mit den Siegen von Erik Seiwald und Miriam Gruber schaffte UBC Vorchdorf den Ausgleich zum 3:3. Bei den beiden abschließenden Spielen – dem Einzel von Florian Brandstötter und dem Mixed von Manuel Weber und Zita Banghegyi – ging es hin und her. Zwischendurch sah es nach einem Remis aus – dann war plötzlich sogar ein Sieg möglich und letztlich wurde eine Niederlage daraus. „Wir waren so knapp am erhofften Unentschieden dran – und dann wieder ein unglückliches Ende“, ärgerte sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl über die „blöde“ Niederlage. In den letzten vier Runden bestreiten die Vorchdorfer ausschließlich Heimspiele, beginnend mit der Doppelrunde am 24. Jänner 2015 gegen Ohlsdorf und Traun. [UBC Vorchdorf]</p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf fährt mit 6:2 gegen WBH Wien II den ersten Bundesliga-Sieg ein </strong><br>Die Nervosität vor dem Spiel gegen den WBH war groß, was besonders in den Herreneinzeln zu sehen war. Doch Andrej Serov und Wimmer Thomas konnten nach schwachem Start ihre Spiele noch drehen und doch sicher gewinnen. Das Herreneinzel zwischen Fink und Fröhlich sowie das Mixdoppel von Maria Fröhlich und Berger Manuel brachten viel Spannung und tolle Szenen für das wieder zahlreich erschienene Publikum. Das waren diesmal wichtige Punkte im Kampf um den Klassenerhalt für Ohlsdorf.

Gleichzeitig „sichert“ Traun damit den Verbleib Wiens auf dem Abstiegsplatz. </p><p>Eine Schützenhilfe, die <strong>Ohlsdorf </strong>nicht gebraucht hätte: mit dem 4:4 gegen <strong>Alkoven </strong>sichert man im Alleingang den Verbleib in der Liga. Alkoven wird als finales Resultat hochwahrscheinlich auf Platz 3 der Tabelle bleiben. Aus dem Alkovener Pressebericht: Das Match gegen die junge Truppe aus Ohlsdorf verlief wie erwartet sehr spannend und ausgeglichen. Letztendlich trennten sich die Mannschaften mit einem gerechten 4:4-Remis. Die Punkte für Alkoven holten Lukas Rebhandl, die Doppel Thomas Hahn/Simon Rebhandl und Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann und das Mixed Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl. Die Meisterschaft ist für den BC Alkoven damit bereits vor dem letzten Spiel gelaufen. Der 3.Platz ist bereits abgesichert, ein Platz im Aufstiegs-Play-Off ist nur noch theoretisch möglich.</p><p><strong>Vorchdorf </strong>rutscht nach einer 3:5-Niederlage gegen Feldkirch auf den vorletzten Tabellenplatz hinter Ohlsdorf. Aus dem Vorchdorfer Pressebericht: Die Chance, den Tabellenführer zu stürzen war da – doch leider legte der Grippevirus und auch schlechtes Spiel die Vorchdorfer auf die „Matte“ und Feldkirch ging als 5:3-Sieger vom Feld. Die halbe Mannschaft wurde in den Tagen vor dem Heimspiel gegen den Leader aus Vorarlberg von einem Grippevirus geplagt. Zwar konnten alle spielen, letztlich fehlte aber die Power. „Die Aufstellung war auch nicht gerade die glücklichste“, so ein selbstkritischer UBC-Obmann Harald Starl. Miriam Gruber / Zita Bahnhegyi mühten sich im Doppel und gewinnen in drei Sätzen. Primoz Flis konnte sein Einzel nach kämpferischer Leistung in 3 Sätzen gewinnen. Miriam Gruber konnte sich nach verloren gegangenem 1. Satz noch zurück kämpfen und ihr Spiel mit 22:24, 21:5, 21:13 gewinnen. Nun musste das Mixed von Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi fürs Unentschieden gewonnen werden. Doch das UBC-Duo konnte nicht an die zuletzt gezeigten Leistungen anknüpfen und verlor in zwei Sätzen. „Nach dem vorzeitigen Erreichen des Klassenerhalts war irgendwie die Luft draußen“, zieht Harald Starl Bilanz. „Und wir waren heute einfach nicht gut genug.“ In drei Wochen (28. Feb. 2015) bestreiten die Vorchdorfer gegen WBH Wien II das letzte Spiel der heurigen Saison. „Wir wollen mit einem Sieg die Saison beenden“, will Starl sein Team nochmals wachrütteln. </p><p>Foto Erik Seiwald (Foto: Jürgen Steppan)</p>","2015-02-06","/content/news/Nach-der-Runde-9-der-Bundesliga-sind-die-Positonen-fix/5b9e502be3d44.png","5");

Platz 5 bedeutet auch, als bestplatzierte Mannschaft ins mittlere Playoff zu kommen. Aus der ersten Bundesliga ist auch der Tabellenletzte, Pressbaum, dabei. Durch ein 6:2 gegen den BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven sichert sich der BC Feldkirch den Meistertitel in der zweiten Bundesliga. Feldkirch ist damit Aufstiegsanwärter im mittleren Playoff, genauso wie der ASKÖ Traun, der relativ ungefährdet auf Platz 2 folgt.</p><p>Pressebricht BC Schweiger-Sport Alkoven vs. BC Feldkirch<br><strong>Unglückliche Niederlage</strong><br>Dass im Sport Sieg und Niederlage ganz eng beieinander liegen, zeigte sich im letzten Spiel der Meisterschaft des Alkovener Badmintonteams. Obwohl die Mannschaft auf zwei  Stammspieler verzichten musste, verlief das Auswärtsspiel in Vorarlberg gegen den Meister BC Feldkirch äußerst spannend und knapp. Leider wurde der großartige Kampfgeist der Alkovener letztendlich nicht belohnt. 3 Spiele gingen nach spannendem Verlauf erst ganz knapp im 3.Satz mit 19:21 verloren. Damit musste die Mannschaft mit einer 2:6 Niederlage die weite Heimreise antreten. Die beiden Punkte holten die Brüder Lukas und Simon Rebhandl im Doppel und Harald Hochgatterer im Einzel. Der 3.Platz in der Tabelle der 2.Bundesliga war bereits vor der Begegnung fix und ist bei der Ausgeglichenheit der Liga ein sehr guter Erfolg. Obmann Fritz Freimüller ist stolz auf sein Team: „So ausgeglichen wie heuer war die Liga noch nie, alle Spiele waren spannend und brachten ausgezeichneten Sport. Mit dem Verlauf der Meisterschaft bin sehr zufrieden und hoffe, dass wir auch in der nächsten Saison wieder so mitmischen können.“ </p><p>Pressebericht UBC Vorchdorf vs. WBH Wien II<br><strong>Happy End für UBC bei Sieg über Wien</strong><br>„Ende gut – alles gut“. Der UBC Vorchdorf beendet mit einem Erfolgserlebnis die Saison. Beim 6:2 Heimsieg über Wien konnten erstmals auch beide Herrendoppel gewonnen werden. Durch den Ausfall von Doppelspezialist Manuel Weber auf Grund einer Grippe waren die Vorchdorfer gezwungen, die Doppel neu zusammen zu setzen. Und: sowohl Primoz Flis / Erik Seiwald (in drei Sätzen) als auch Dominik Kronsteiner / Florian Brandstötter konnten jeweils ihr Spiel gewinnen. „Wir haben heute unsere Doppelausbeute verdoppelt,“ zeigte sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl erfreut. Die Vormachtstellung gegen die leicht ersatzgeschwächten Wiener demonstrierten Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi im Damendoppel und Florian Brandstötter und Erik Seiwald in den Einzel, die Vorchdorf mit 5:0 in Front brachten. Trotz Rückenproblemen kämpfte Primoz Flis beherzt, musste sich aber gegen Jun Mai knapp in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben. Miriam Gruber fixierte mit ihrem 9 Saisonsieg im Dameneinzel den souveränen 6:2 Heimerfolg. Mit dem Sieg überholten die Vorchdorfer noch Lokalrivalen Ohlsdorf in der Tabelle und schlossen die Saison mit dem 4. Endrang ab. „Alles im allem eine tolle Saison, obwohl rückwirkend betrachtet noch ein wenig mehr möglich gewesen wäre,“ bilanziert Harald Starl die 21. Bundesliga Saison der Vorchdorfer.  </p><p><strong>Mittleres Playoff</strong><br>Sa 11.04.2015 15:00    ASV Pressbaum    –    BSC 70 Linz        Sporthalle Sacré Coeur<br>Sa 11.04.2015 15:00    BC Feldkirch    –    ASKÖ Traun        Oberauhalle Feldkich<br>Sa 18.04.2015 15:00    BSC 70 Linz    –    BC Feldkirch        AHS Solar City Halle Linz<br>Sa 18.04.2015 18:00    ASKÖ Traun    –    ASV Pressbaum        Haka Arena<br>Sa 25.04.2015 15:00    BC Feldkirch    –    ASV Pressbaum        Oberauhalle Feldkich<br>Sa 25.04.2015 15:00    BSC 70 Linz    –    ASKÖ Traun        AHS Solar City Halle Linz        </p>","2015-03-03","/content/news/Bundesliga-BSC-70-Linz-und-ASKOE-Traun-matchen-sich-im-mittleren-Playoff/5b9e544e389ae.png","4");

Mai Gastgeber beim Senior Masters, dem Doppelturnier der besonderen Art. Die Altersklassen mögen für Außenstehende ungewöhnlich erscheinen, wurde doch auch in der Kategorie Herrendoppel 120+ gespielt. Die Klasse wurde durch das Zusammenrechnen des Alters der einzelnen SpielerInnen ermittelt.</p><p>Bürgermeister Harald Seidl, Sportausschuss-Vorsitzender Christoph Sagmüller und OÖBV-Präsident Herbert Koch eröffneten das Turnier, an dem 76 SpielerInnen aus Vereinen aus Oberösterreich, Salzburg, Kärnten, Niederösterreich, Steiermark und Wien sehr motiviert teilnahmen. Die meisten SportlerInnen stellte – neben dem Gastgeber – das Maxx Sportcenter und ASK Nettingsdorf – beide durften sich über eine Dressengarnitur der Firma Babolat freuen. Ältester Sportler war Helmuth Kreulitsch vom Askö Klagenfurt, immerhin Jahrgang 1939!! Die Spiele wurden sehr fair und ausgeglichen geführt – glücklicherweise auch verletzungsfrei.</p><p>Gesellschaftlicher Höhepunkt war die Players-Party am Samstag, bei der es nicht nur Speis und Trank gab, sondern auch eine äußerst unterhaltsame Kabaretteinlage von Thomas Martetschläger sowie die Verlosung der Tombolapreise. Auch Vizebürgermeister Rudolf Scharinger schaute vorbei. Bis um Mitternacht war die Stimmung sehr ausgelassen, und die SportlerInnen waren sich einig, dass diese Veranstaltung wiederholt werden muss.</p><p>Am Sonntag wurden die SiegerInnen ermittelt, gegen 14.00 Uhr fand die Siegerehrung statt, an der noch fast alle SpielerInnen teilnahmen. Erfreulicherweise durfte sich auch der Gastgeber Askö Traun über 2 Titel freuen.</p><p>Der Askö Traun bedankt sich bei allen TeilnehmerInnen, der Stadt Traun, bei Babolat und Auto Eder für die Unterstützung sowie beim gesamten Organisationsteam für die gute Zusammenarbeit. Über eine Weiterführung des Senior Masters wurde bereits eifrig diskutiert, und die TraunerInnen freuen sich auf eine Wiedersehen im nächsten Jahr.</p><p>GewinnerInnen<br>HD 70+<br> 1 Kammel Wolfgang/Philip Varghese (BC Donaustadt/Club VIC BC)<br> 2 Schneider Norbert/Walter Georg (BC St. Pölten/Mödling)<br> 3 Auberger Otmar/Froschauer Alexander (Askö Traun)</p><p>HD 90+<br> 1 El Dabbagh Tarek/Mayr Gerhard (U.

Nicht nur die Spieler und Vereinsvertreter freuten sich über den Sieg gegen Traun und den Verbleib in der 1. Liga. „Viele SMS hatten mich gestern erreicht wo uns zum Sieg und Verbleib in der 1. Liga gratuliert wurde“ freut sich der Obmann des BSC 70 Linz.<br>Wir hatten glücklicherweise alles in eigener Hand den Verbleib in der 1. Liga zu fixieren. Ein 4:4 Unentschieden hätte uns schon gereicht. Zwar war Trauns Nr.1 – Jürgen Koch – nicht mit dabei, dennoch boten wir die beste Mannschaft an diesem Tag auf. Nach einem schnellen 4:0 (und damit vorzeitigen Entscheidung) ließ die Konzentration merklich nach. Das Team hatte jetzt allen Grund zu feiern.</p><p>Dennoch wurden die Spiele noch ordentlich zu Ende gespielt – Schlussendlich wollte man den zahlreich erschienen Fans beider Mannschaften noch tolles Badminton liefern. Das 6:2 geht komplett in Ordnung. Damit konnten wir auch dem ASV Pressbaum (die sich in Feldkirch schwer taten und 5:3 gewannen) Schützenhilfe leisten.</p><p>Nach dem Spiel löste Miha Horvat sein Versprechen ein und ließ sich seinen über die letzten Wochen gewachsenen Bart durch Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger schneiden. Das Team und die beiden hatten eine Menge Spaß. Den Abend ließ man noch gemeinsam, gemütlich ausklingen.</p><p>Fazit: Ein Abstiegskampf ist immer unangenehm für die Teams. Pressbaum & Linz konnten die 1. Bundesliga bestätigen, hatten aber hart dafür zu arbeiten. Im Lager des BSC 70 Linz geht jetzt die Planung für die kommende Saison los, in der Hoffnung, dass man kommende Saison wieder mit um den Titel spielen kann.

Derby zum Showdown im mittleren Playoff: Der Sieger der Begegnung wird kommende Saison fix in der 1. Liga spielen.<br><strong><br> OÖ Derby Askö BSC 70 Linz gegen Askö Traun – 25.4.2015, 15 Uhr, AHS Solar City</strong></p><p><strong>Hoffentlich kommen auch viele Zuseher. BSC 70 Linz gegen Askö Traun ist & war immer schon ein Garant für eine tolle Atmosphäre, viel Action und spannende Matches voller Emotion.</strong></p><p><em>Aus dem Vorbericht des BSC 70 Linz:</em><br>Mit einem klaren Sieg gegen die Meister der 2. Bundesliga Feldkirch und einem Unentschieden gegen ASV Pressbaum hat der BSC 70 Linz eine sehr gute Ausgangslage für den Verbleib in der 1. Bundesliga. Die bisherige Saison und die Nichtqualifikation zum Play-off Halbfinale war nicht nach dem Wunsch der Spieler und der Vereinsführung gelaufen. Wie eng die Liga ist zeigen die Matches im Halbfinale – der 4. Klagenfurt zwang den 1. Mödling in ein drittes Spiel und hatte sogar die Chance auf´s Finale.</p><p>Ausgangssituation: Dem BSC 70 Linz reicht ein Unentschieden um auch kommende Saison in der 1. Bundesliga aufschlagen zu können. Askö Traun muss auf jeden Fall gewinnen. Für Spannung ist in jedem Fall gesorgt. Unser Team, rund um Wolfgang und Rüdiger Gnedt, will unbedingt gegen Traun bestehen. Der Sieg gegen Feldkirch hat uns gut getan – es ist ein Ruck durch die Mannschaft gegangen. Das wird man auch im Oö. Derby brauchen – das Duell Linz gegen Traun hat immer einen besonderen Flair. Seit vielen Jahren kämpfen beide Mannschaften in der Bundesliga und haben viele legendäre Duelle geliefert. Im Parallelspiel muss Pressbaum in Feldkirch zumindest ein Unentschieden holen um ebenfalls in der 1. Liga zu bleiben.</p><p>„Nebenschauplatz“: Spielertrainer Miha Horvat, der sich seit der 1. Runde im Play-off nicht mehr rasiert hat, wird bei einem hoffentlich positiv ausgehenden OÖ Derby, nach dem Spiel seinen Bart verlieren. „Ich hoffe meine „Aktion“ gibt meinem BSC 70 Linz das notwendige Glück zurück“ weiß der langjährige Spielertrainer des BSC 70 Linz Miha Horvat. Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger weiß diesen Einsatz zu schätzen – „Ich finde es eine tolle Aktion von Miha – ich werde gerne derjenige sein, der ihm den Bart stutzen darf“ lacht und freut sich der Obmann bereits auf das OÖ. Derby.</p><p><em>Aus dem letzten Spielbericht des ASKÖ Traun:</em></p><p><strong>210 Minuten Spannung!</strong><br>Die Partie im Bundesliga-Aufstiegs-Playoff gegen Pressbaum am 18. April in der Trauner Haka-Arena entwickelte sich zum Badminton-Krimi. Die TraunerInnen unterlagen zwar mit 3:5, aber auch ein Sieg oder Unentschieden wäre möglich gewesen. Gleich 7 von 8 Matches wurden erst im 3. Satz entschieden, die rund 70 ZuschauerInnen erlebten einen spannenden Badminton-Abend und feuerten ihr Team enthusiastisch an.Beide Herrendoppel – die Aushängerschilder des Askö Traun – gingen ungewohnt an die Gäste. Jürgen Koch/Alexander Serov und Peter Zauner/Jakob Ostermann mussten ihr Spiel jeweils abgeben. Dafür legten sich die Damen ordentlich ins Zeug: Barbara Scheer/Barbara Galos holten das Damendoppel und damit den 1. Punkt für die TraunerInnen.  Auch Markus Ratzenböck (3. HE) bot Paroli, aber er musste sich im 3. Satz geschlagen geben, damit lag Pressbaum bereits mit 3:1 in Führung.</p><p>Jürgen Koch (1. HE) und Peter Zauner (2. HE) sorgten mit ihren Siegen zwischenzeitlich für den Ausgleich. Nachdem Barbara Galos ihr Dameneinzel abgeben musste, lag es es nun am Mixeddoppel Barbara Scheer/Klaus Dornig zumindest noch einen Punkt zu retten. Bis zum 3. Satz hielten die beiden den Ausgang offen, mussten sich aber geschlagen geben.</p><p>Auch wenn die knappe Niederlage schmerzt, müssen die TraunerInnen die Köpfe nicht hängen lassen. Man hat dem Team aus Pressbaum alles abverlangt. Am 25. April tritt der Askö Traun auswärts zur entscheidenden Partie gegen BSC Linz an (15.00 Uhr, Solar City Halle). Die LinzerInnen setzten sich mit 8:0 gegen Feldkirch durch.</p>","2015-04-24","/content/news/Samstag-1500-Solarcity-BSC-70-Linz-ndash-ASKOE-Traun-Die-erfolgreichsten-Badmintonvereine-OEsterreichs-kaempfen-um-die-1-Bundesliga/5b9e565e36816.png","5");

Sollten wir den Heimvorteil nützen können, sind wir trotzdem nicht ganz chancenlos. Aber realistisch betrachtet sind die Niederösterreicher zu favorisieren. Im ersten Spiel in Vorarlberg hatte sicher die Erfahrung unserer Routiniers einen wichtigen Anteil am Erfolg.

Wolfgang gelang es leider nur am Beginn des 2. Satzes ohne Eigenfehler und mit druckvollem Spiel zu agieren. Vor allem aber im 1. Satz unterliefen ihm zu viele leichte Fehler. „Auf diesem Niveau darf mir das nicht passieren. Die Taktik an sich hat gut gepasst, aber die vielen Fehler dürfen nicht passieren. Das 1. Jahr in der höheren Altersklasse ist nicht einfach.

Vom 30. März bis 4. April 2015 finden in Lubin (POL) die U19-Individual-Europameisterschaften 2015 statt. Eine Medaille wäre auch der große Traum in diesem Jahr.</p><p>Schwierige Situation: „Neben Maturavorbereitung auch noch genug Zeit für Training finden ist derzeit nicht immer leicht“, so Wolfgang Gnedt. In knapp einem Monat wird Wolfgang bei der Matura antreten und auch diese hoffentlich gut meistern. Zeit für Training bleibt dann manchmal erst spät am Abend.</p><p>Trotz des gedrängten Terminkalenders in diesem Jahr mit Individualturnieren (mehrere Int. U19 Turniersiege), Bundesliga für den BSC 70 Linz und den Staatsmeisterschaften der allg. Klasse in Linz freut sich Wolfgang während der Osterferienwoche auf die U19 Europameisterschaften in Polen (Lublin): „Der 3. Platz bei der Heim-Staatsmeisterschaft in Linz hat mir nochmal Auftrieb für die Doppelbelastung gegeben.“</p><p>Mit dem heutigen Sieg in der zweiten Runde gegen Palmi Gudfinnsson (ISL) konnte er souverän mit 21-6 21-17 besiegen. Am Mittwoch 1.4.2015 wird Wolfgang gegen Oleksandar SHMUNDYAK (UKR) antreten. Dieser hat seinen Gegner in der zweiten Runde mit 21-7 21-1 aus dem Turnier geworfen.

Anschließend zeigten Lukas und Philipp in einem kurzen Showmatch wie man Badminton spielt, ehe dann die Talente zeigen konnten, was sie bereits gelernt hatten. Auch die Eltern und Geschwister versuchten sich in ersten Schlägen und zeigten reges Interesse an Badminton. Insgesamt nahmen 12 Kinder im Alter von 6-9 regelmäßig montags an den Trainings teil. Das Talentnest, welches vom ÖBV und der PH finanziert wird ist ein Projekt um Schüler näher an den Sport zu bringen. Da es ein wichtiges Projekt im Nachwuchsbereich ist, passt dies perfekt zu den Ambitionen und Zielen von ASKÖ Linz Badminton sich vor allem im Nachwuchs Bereich zu engagieren.</p><p>Wir hoffen, dass dieses Projekt auch im nächsten Jahr fortgeführt werden kann und bereits die ersten Talente mit dem Vereinstraining beginnen werden.</p><p>Bericht: ASKÖ Linz Badminton</p>","2015-07-06","/content/news/Talentnest-in-der-EuropaschuleLinz/5b9e5a3c637c6.png","12");

Es konnten sich 6 Damen und 24 Herren aus folgenden Vereinen BC Raiffeisen Alkoven, BV Zell am See, BC Windischgarsten, BC UNION Walserfeld, SK Vöest, UNION Neuhofen, UNION Vorchdorf, USC Attergau, UNION Stadl-Paura, UNION Kirchdorf, UNION Urfahr, ATV Andorf und ASK Nettingsdorf-Badminton/Racketlon motivieren. Bei diesem Turnier war das Durchschnittsalter von den 6 Damen 27 Jahre und bei den 24 Herren 35 Jahre. Beim 1. D-RLT war das Durchschnittsalter 37 Jahre. Also kann man daraus schließen dass in der Nord-Gruppe die junggebliebenen um die 30 Jahre sind.

Das österreichisch-dänische Paar kam kampflos aus der Qualifikation in den Hauptbewerb. Im Hauptbewerb besiegten die Beiden das Top-Doppel aus Belgien Matijs Dierickx / Freek Golinski in 2 Sätzen mit 22:20 und 21:15. Im Achtelfinale geht es morgen gegen die beiden Asiaten Chen Hung Ling / Chi-Lin Wang aus Chinese Taipei.</p><p>Kommentar von Jürgen Koch:<br>„Nach der langen Pause haben wir uns keine großen Chancen gegen das belgische Nr. 1 Doppel ausgerechnet. Wir hatten mit der Nr. 8 der Weltrangliste und Franch- Open- Finalist, Mats Conrad Petersen (Den), einen prominenten Coach, der uns wertvolle Anweisungen gab und uns großartig unterstützte. Realistisch betrachtet sind die morgigen Gegner klar zu favorisieren. Wir wollen uns gegen Hung Ling / Chi-Lin Wang (einer der Beiden war bereits Nr. 8 der WRL, derzeit Nr. 26) trotzdem so teuer als möglich verkaufen. Trotz meiner langen Karriere macht es immer wieder Spaß und Freude bei großen Turnieren dabei zu sein und mit den jüngeren Athleten auch mithalten zu können. </p><p>Das Achtelfinale findet am 29.

Bundesliga konnte die Trauner Mannschaft um Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner mit 2 Siegen das angestrebte Ziel zu 100%   erreichen.<br>Im ersten Spiel ging es am Samstag gegen den Vorjahresmeister UBC Feldkirch. Diese Begegnung war an Spannung kaum zu überbieten und wurde erst im letzten der 8 Spiele entschieden. Die neu in die Mannschaft gekommene Indonesierin Meisy Jolly Lee konnte die in sie gesteckten Erwartungen zur Gänze erfüllen. Sie gewann ihre beiden Matches und trug damit maßgeblich zum Sieg bei.<br>Das letzte Siel, dass das entscheidende Mixed Doppel, sah eineinhalb Sätze lang relativ klar zu Gunsten der Trauner aus. Am Ende des 2. Satzes wurden die Vorarlberger immer stärker und gewannen den Satz 23:21. Der 3. Satz war bis zum Schluss hart umkämpf, den letztlich Jürgen Koch und Barbara Scheer mit 21:19 zum 5:3 für die Oberösterreicher entscheiden konnten. Insgesamt wurden 4 Spiele erst im 3. Satz entschieden.</p><p>Das am Folgetag ausgetragene Lokalderby gegen UBC Vorchdorf war ebenso im gesamten Verlauf durch knappe Ergebnisse geprägt. Mit einer etwas geänderten Aufstellung gegenüber dem Vortag versuchte ASKÖ Traun zu den erforderlichen 5 Punkten zu kommen, was letztlich auch gelang. Die Schlüsselspiele zugunsten von Traun waren die Siege von Jürgen Koch im 1. HE  und Jolly Meisy LEE Damen- Einzel.</p><p>Manager Herbert Koch nach dem Wochenende:<br>„Wir haben an diesem Wochenende das Plansoll erfüllt und dabei für den Rest der Meisterschaft einige wichtige Erkenntnisse gesammelt. Unsere Nr. 1 Dame J. M. LEE aus Indonesien hat trotz der erst am Vortag angetretenen Anreise aus Asien Ihre Spiele gewonnen und ist damit eine Verstärkung für unser Team. Die Routiniers Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner sind nach wie vor ein wichtiger Bestandteil unserer Mannschaft und die Orientierung für unsere Truppe. Vor allem die jungen Mannschaftsmitglieder haben die Möglichkeit, sich im Schatten der Routiniers, im Laufe der Meisterschaft zu entwickeln und wichtige Punkte in der entscheidenden Phase beizutragen. Das erste Ziel, nämlich das Erreichen der Play-Off Spiele zur ersten Liga erscheint realistisch.“</p><p>UBC Vorchdorf</p><p>Durch die „verrückte“ Spielansetzung der Klosterneuburger musste das UBC Team die Reise in den Osten Österreichs früh antreten. Bei der Aufstellung überraschte das UBC-Team mit dem Einsatz von Oldie Peter Moritz. Im nicht gerade Bundesliga gewöhnten Ambiente (schlechte Lichtverhältnisse, Hallenausstattung) waren die Vorchdorfer jedoch hell wach. So konnten alle drei Doppelspiele gewonnen werden und die Gäste führten rasch mit 3 : 0. Während Primoz Flis das Topeinzel ebenso wie Erik Seiwald verlor, kam nochmals Spannung auf. Miriam Gruber stand gegen Jugendnationalspielerin Meinke am Rande einer Niederlage und musste 6 (!) Matchbälle abwehren, ehe sie den Angriff der Jugend abwehrte und noch siegreich den Court verlassen konnte. Den Schlußpunkt setzten Peter Moritz und Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi mit klaren Siegen zum 6 : 2 Auswärtserfolg. </p><p>Teil zwei der Doppelrunde führte UBC Vorchdorf zum Tabellenführer nach Traun. Die Trauner hatten ihre neue Legionärin aus Indonesien im Einsatz und gingen als klarer Favorit ins Spiel. Doch das UBC Team zeigte sich von seiner kämpferischen Seite. Zwar gingen die beiden Herren Doppel an Traun, so konnten Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi mit ihrem Sieg verkürzen. Im Topeinzel zeigte Primoz Flis sein bestes Spiel im UBC-Dress. Der junge Slovene forderte Altstar Jürgen Koch und hielt lange das Spiel offen, ehe er dem hohen Tempo Tribut zollen musste und mit 21:13, 15:21, 17:21 unterlag. Erik Seiwald gelang mit seinem Dreisatzsieg abermals der Anschluss. Eine tolle kämpferische Leistung bot Peter Moritz gegen Youngster Witzmann – der UBC Oldie siegte in drei Sätzen. Im abschließenden Mixed war dann wenig zu holen – Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi unterlagen gegen Zauner / Jolly Lee klar in zwei Sätzen.</p><p>„Traun bleibt unser Angstgegner“, muss UBC Obmann Harald Starl einmal mehr zur Kenntnis nehmen. In den 23 Jahren der Bundesliga Zugehörigkeit konnten die Vorchdorf noch nie gewinnen. </p><p>BC Raiffeisen Alkoven</p><p>Die Alkovener kamen dann aber doch, vor allem durch ihre Doppelstärke an diesem Tag, zu einem verdienten 5:3 Erfolg. Die beiden Herrendoppel Thomas Hahn/Simon Rebhandl und Harald Hochgatterer/Lukas Rebhandl legten vor, dann siegte auch das Damendoppel Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann in 3 Sätzen.<br>Anschließend stellte Harald Hochgatterer mit einer tollen Leistung sogar auf 4:0.<br>Lukas Rebhand startete stark und gewann den 1.Satz. Dann aber fehlte es immer mehr an Selbstvertrauen und so verlor er sein Spiel im Entscheidungssatz. Thomas Hahn spielte auch eine starke Partie, konnte aber in beiden Sätzen am Ende die entscheidenden Punkte nicht für sich verbuchen.

Der OÖBV freut sich, dass sich doch einige Personen gefunden haben, die aktiv mithelfen wollen den Sport und vor allem den Nachwuchssport in Oberösterreich weiter voran zu treiben.</p><p>Unter der Leitung von Peter Zauner wurden auch schon die ersten Maßnahmen besprochen. Es wurde vereinbart, dass in Zukunft ein Coach und/oder ein Betreuer aus Oberösterreich (Betreuerpool OÖBV) bei allen österreichweiten Jugend- und Schüler Turnieren dabei sein soll. Es ist vorgesehen, dass der OÖBV  auch bei der Organisation des Transports (gemeinsame Anreise), Quartiere, Nennung (wie bisher) und Betreuung beim Turnier mithelfen wird. Diese Maßnahmen sollen den Teamgeist stärker fördern, um in Zukunft wieder als einheitliches Team OÖ aufzutreten. Ziel ist es in Zukunft wieder ein Kadersystem für den Nachwuchs zu entwickeln. Es ist geplant, dass der OÖBV T-Shirts zur Verfügung stellen wird um bei Turnieren einheitlich aufzutreten. Des Weiteren wurden Sichtungsmaßnahmen bei OÖ-Schüler und Jugendturnieren beschlossen, um früher auf Talente aus Oberösterreich aufmerksam zu werden. Weitere Themen waren die Besetzung des Nachwuchsreferenten, Breitensportmaßnahmen (Technikkurse), Region Nord Talente-Trainings, Projekteinreichungen und Vermarktung des Badmintonsports.<br>Die nächste Sportausschuss-Sitzung findet im Dezember statt, wo versucht wird an den bisherigen Themen weiter zu arbeiten sowie neue Visionen zu entwickeln, um den Nachwuchssport in Oberösterreich weiter voranzutreiben.<br>Teilnehmer: Peter Zauner (Vizepräsident, Borgkoordinator,-Trainer), Karin Burger (Schriftführerin), Daniel Walchshofer, Stefan Holl, Otmar Auberger, Peter Kickinger, Jo Hoffelner, Sepp Retschitzegger , Entschuldigt: Markus Garsleitner</p><p>[Bericht: Peter Zauner]</p>","2015-10-14","/content/news/OOEBV-Sportausschuss/5b9ffddcc1a75.png","4");

Im Spitzenspiel ging es heiß her, ehe sich Lukas Rebhandl gegen den Ungarn Nemeth knapp im 3.Satz geschlagen geben musste. Rebhandl konnte leider im 2.Satz 2 Matchbälle nicht verwerten. Thomas Hahn hingegen zeigte eine bravouröse Leistung und besiegte seinen Gegner in 2 Sätzen. Während Maria Steinmann sich trotz großartiger kämpferischer Leistung geschlagen geben musste, spielte Harald Hochgatterer seine Routine aus und siegte klar. Das abschließende Mixed war damit nur noch Kosmetik, Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl spielten groß auf und ließen insgesamt nur 5 Gegenpunkte zu.<br>Mit diesem Sieg holte sich das Alkovener Team viel Selbstvertrauen für die nächsten Matches. </p><p><strong>ASKÖ Traun</strong><br>Das neuformierte Bundesliga-Team musste am 10.

Mödling wurde der Favoritenrolle eindeutig gerecht. Der Mannschaftsmeister konnte sich bei den Herren auch durch Olympiakanditat Luka Wraber (Weltrangliste Nr. 53; Stand 8.10.2015) sehr gut verstärken. Mit Sicherheit ist Mödling Titelkanditat Nr.1 und trat zur 1. Begegnung auch mit kompletten Kader an.</p><p>Alle Spiele waren spannend, ausgeglichen und machten den vielen Badmintonfans sicherlich & sichtlich Spaß. In Summe 3,5 Stunden tolle Ballwechsel und das in jeder Partie zeigten, auf welch hohem Niveau die österreichische Bundesliga angekommen ist.<br>Ebenfalls zufrieden sind wir mit der Vorstellung von Vitaliy Konov. Im Spitzenspiel gegen Luka Wraber sahen wir Spitzenballwechsel. Vor allem am Ende des 1. Satzes konnte man das Potential beider sehr gut sehen. Für uns schade, dass Vitaliy diesen 1. Satz nicht für sich entscheiden konnte. Im zweiten Satz das selbe Bild. Top Ballwechsel, doch diesmal leichtere Fehler zu Ende des Satzes von Vitaliy. Auf jeden Fall ist es eine Freude Vitaliy Konov, aber mit Sicherheit beide Spieler in der österreichischen Liga zu haben.<br>Wolfgang Gnedt, wie immer äußert effektiv und eine Bank im 3. Einzel, zeigte eine sehr gute Form vor der U19 WM.<br>Im Doppel zeige Wolfgang ebenfalls eine Starke Leistung an der Seite von Miha Ivanic die leider nicht in einem Matchgewinn bei ersten Match endete.</p><p>Ein tolles Spiel machte auch die 20jährige Ana-Marija Setina. Im Einzel hielt sie das Match gegen Katrin Neudolt über weite Strecken des Matches offen. Leider unterliefen ihr in den entscheidenden Phasen taktische Fehler. Im Mixed Doppel zeigte sie gemeinsam mit Miha Horvat ebenfalls was sie kann. Auf jeden Fall ein toller Einstand. 1 Sieg und eine unnötige Niederlage ist ihre Bilanz nach dem 1. Spieltag.</p><p>Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger nach dem Spiel: „ein wenig schmerzt die Niederlage zum Auftakt schon. Ein Unentschieden wäre sicher drinnen gewesen. Jetzt heißt es Konstanz in das Spiel zu bekommen und die richtige Paarungen im Doppel finden. Die Mannschaft hat tolle Moral bewiesen und zu keiner Zeit aufgegeben. Die neuen Spieler haben sich bereits gut ins Team eingebracht. Schlussendlich zählt aber nur der Erfolg; Nachdem ersten Spiel sieht man wo man steht.

UBC Vorchdorf beginnt die Saison auswärts gegen den Titelverteidiger BC Monfort Feldkirch. Die junge Mannschaft von Union Ohlsdorf beginnt mit dem OÖ Derby gegen ASKÖ Traun. Abschließend bekommt es BC Raiffeisen Alkoven mit dem Aufsteiger Union Racketlon Klosterneuburg zu tun. </p><p>Nachfolgend die Statements der sportlichen Leiter / Obmänner</p><p><strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong> (Harald Starl)<br>Alles andere als leicht ist für Vorchdorf der Start in die neue Badminton Bundesliga Saison. Das UBC Team muss zum Auftakt beim Titelverteidiger Feldkirch antreten.<br>Neben der langen Anreise ins Ländle, wartet auch eine zum Vorjahr mit Legionären verstärke Feldkircher Mannschaft. „Dagegen halten, so gut es geht,“ lautet die Devise für Kronsteiner & Co. Unverändert blieb jedoch das UBC Team. „Kontinuität und Einsatz sollen im Kampf um die Play-off Plätze und den Klassenerhalt der Trumpf der Vorchdorfer sein,“  womit auch UBC-Obmann Harald Starl das Saisonziel vorgibt.<br>Primosz Flis, der mit der Teilnahme an den European Games in Baku und der Universiade in Korea mit viel neuer Motivation zum UBC Team stoßen wird, soll auch in der neuen Saison als Nr. 1 für die nötigen Punkte sorgen. Dominik Kronsteiner, Erik Seiwald, Peter Moritz, Florian Brandstötter, Manuel Weber (mit Hüftproblemen derzeit außer Gefecht), sowie die Damen Miriam Gruber und Zita Banhegyi vervollständigen das UBC-Team.</p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf</strong> (Sepp Retschitzegger)<br>Unsere Spieler haben sich im Sommertraining intensiv vorbereitet. Die jungen Spieler sind ja nicht nur auf Erfolge in der Bundesliga heiß, sondern wollen sich auch im heimischen Turniergeschehen in den Vordergrund spielen. Beim ersten A Ranglistenturnier konnte mit Kathi Hochmeir erstmals eine Ohlsdorferin dieses Turnier gewinnen, aber auch die restlichen Ohlsdorfer setzten sich außerordentlich gut in Szene.  Die Mannschaft ist unverändert und wir werden sicher wieder von unserem großen Kader profitieren. Zukäufe wollen wir uns nicht leisten, sondern wir stecken unsere Mittel in die weitere Ausbildung unserer eigenen Spieler. Natürlich ist unser Ziel auch heuer wieder, dem Abstieg zu entkommen, wobei wir doch mit einem guten Mittelfeldplatz rechnen. </p><p><strong>ASKÖ Traun</strong> (Herbert Koch)<br>Die Vorbereitung bei ASKÖ Traun verlief besser als in den vergangenen Jahren. Aufgrund der verschiedenen geografischen Positionen einiger Mannschaftsmitglieder konnte allerdings eine gemeinsame Vorbereitung nicht durchgeführt werden. Vor den jeweiligen Runden sind jedoch gemeinsame Maßnahmen geplant. Traun hat sich bei den Damen mit Jolly Lee Meisy aus Indonesien, Raphaela Winkler aus Vorarlberg und bei den Herren mit Philip Birker aus der Steiermark, Rafael Witzmann aus NÖ und Daniel Zazka aus Wien verstärkt. Unser Ziel ist das Erreichen des Mittleren Play-offs. In den ersten Runden müssen wir erst die richtige Mannschaftsaufstellung finden, die Erwartungen sind zu Beginn nicht all zu hoch, wenngleich wir natürlich immer gewinnen wollen, sagt Herbert Koch, Trauns sportlicher Leiter. </p><p><strong>BC Raiffeisen Alkoven</strong> (Fritz Freimüller)<br>Die Mannschaft von BC Raiffeisen Alkoven bleibt im Vergleich zur abgelaufenen Saison unverändert. Die Vorbereitungen verliefen gut und wir gehen mit großer Motivation in die neue Saison. Da die Liga sehr ausgeglichen zu sein scheint und wir einen relativ engen Kader haben, hoffen wir vor allem auf eine verletzungsfreie Saison. Mit etwas Glück können wir vielleicht auch wieder vorne mitmischen. Das erste Spiel gegen den Aufsteiger Union Racketlon Klosterneuburg wird schwer, da wir den Gegner noch nicht einschätzen können. Wir freuen uns aber auf die Begegnung und hoffen auf kräftige Unterstützung der Zuschauer, so Alkovens Obmann Fritz Freimüller.</p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion, ÖBV]</p>","2015-10-08","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-2-Bundesliga-Saison-20152016/5b9ffed59fd17.png","6");

Beide Teams setzten routinierte Spieler ein und es begann von Beginn ab ein fairer Schlagabtausch auf Augenhöhe. Ohlsdorf ging zwar mit<br>1 : 0 in Führung, doch das UBC-Team konterte mit den Siegen von Dominik Kronsteiner / Peter Moritz und Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi und ging so selbst in Führung. Während Primoz Flis das Topeinzel in drei Sätzen für Vorchdorf entschied, musste sich Erik Seiwald nach starkem Beginn noch in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben. Im Dameneinzel konnte Ohlsdorfs Shooting-Star Katarina Hochmeier Ex-Staatsmeisterin Miriam Gruber knapp in drei Sätzen bezwingen und nochmals ausgleichen. Doch Oldie Peter Moritz leistete Dank seiner Fitness erneut Youngster Fröhlich großen Wiederstand und siegte, für viele überraschend, in zwei Sätzen. Somit lagen alle Trümpfe bei den Heimischen. Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi dominierten den Eröffnungssatz im Mixed klar, mussten aber auf Grund vieler Konzentrationsfehler den 2. Satz abgeben, ehe sie mit 21:14 im Entscheidungssatz den 5 : 3 Derbysieg für UBC Vorchdorf fixierten. </p><p>„In diesem Spiel war jeder Ausgang möglich – Dank unserer Routine konnten wir einen glücklichen, aber verdienten Derbysieg einfahren,“ strahlte UBC Obmann Harald Starl nach dem drei stündigen Krimi.<br>Mit dem Sieg machte UBC Vorchdorf den Sprung auf Rang 3 in der Tabelle, der im direkten Duell Anfang Dezember gegen Alkoven abgesichert werden soll.</p><p><strong>ASKÖ Traun: </strong></p><p>Mit einem klaren 8:0 Sieg gegen BC Raiffeisen Alkoven hat am Wochenende das Team der ASKÖ Traun die Tabellenführung in der 2. Badminton- Bundesliga verteidigt. Dabei haben  neben den Routiniers die Nachwuchssportlerinnen- und Sportler  überzeugt und einen weiteren Entwicklungsschritt vorwärts bewiesen. Die Beiden 15- jährigen Mädchen Raphaela Winkler und Lena Zinganell, sowie  der 17-jährige Philip Birker rechtfertigten ihre Einsätze mit Siegen bei  ihren Partien. Für die weiteren Punkte sorgten Jürgen Koch, Peter Zauner, Jakob Ostermann und Markus Ratzenböck bei den Herren und die Indonesierin Meisy Jolly LEE bei den Damen.</p><p>Manager Koch Herbert nach dem Derby:<br>„Als Tabellenführer waren wir natürlich in der Favoritenrolle. Dieser Umstand veranlasste uns bei der Aufstellung etwas zu ändern und dem Nachwuchs eine Chance zu geben. Die Rechnung ging zu 100% auf und es war  ein wichtiger Entwicklungsschritt für das  gesamte Team. Was besonders auffällt, ist der positive Teamgeist, der vor allem durch unsere Leistungsträger Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner vorgelebt wird. Neben der Konzentration auf Ihre eigenen Spiele versuchen die Beiden ihre Erfahrung laufend den übrigen Mannschaftsmitgliedern zu übermitteln. Auch die Indonesierin Meisy Jolly Lee gibt unseren Mädchen einiges an Erfahrung mit. Der Umstand, dass wir noch personelle Reserven heben stimmt uns zuversichtlich und kann in der entscheidenden Phase der Meisterschaft noch wichtig werden. Derzeit kommen wir unserem Plan, nämlich das Erreichen der Aufstiegs-Play off Spiele zur 1. Bundesliga immer näher. Wir freuen uns schon auf die nächste Begegnung Anfang Dezember.“  </p><p>[Bericht: UBC Vorchdorf, ASKÖ Traun und Redaktion]</p>","2015-11-08","/content/news/Ergebnisse-der-4-Runde-der-2-Bundesliga/5ba0018e742f1.png","4");

Union Ohlsdorf konnte hingegen gegen BC Feldkirch kein Spiel gewinnen und musste sich mit einem 0:8 aus dem Ländle verabschieden.

Damit liegen sie auf Platz 3 und UBC Vorchdorf steht nach der Hinrunde auf dem vierten Platz.</p><p>Hier die Pressemeldungen der Mannschaften</p><p><strong>ASKÖ Traun:</strong><br>„Wir freuen uns natürlich über den positiven Abschluss des Grunddurchganges. Die zu Saisonbeginn geholten Neuverpflichtungen haben die Mannschaft gut ergänzt und Varianten bei den Mannschaftsaufstellungen ermöglicht. Für die nächste Saison muss sich die Bundesliga in Bezug auf  Beginn Zeiten etwas überlegen.  Wenn man weiß, aus welchen Motiven heraus Termine wie Samstag 10 Uhr angesetzt werden, muss man unbedingt die Vorschriften entsprechend anpassen. Derartige Hobbysport- Überlegungen haben in der Bundesliga nichts verloren und werden unseren Sport nicht wirklich weiterbringen. Gerade Vereine die vorgeben, Spitzensport zu betreiben, sollten diesen Gedanken auch leben. Wir freuen uns bereits auf die Rückrunde und hoffen auf einen Top 2 Platz, was die  Qualifikation für das Aufstiegs- Play off zur 1. Bundesliga bedeutet.“</p><p><strong>UBC Vorchdorf:</strong><br>Obwohl die Vorchdorfer ihre wohl besten Herrendoppelspiele der Saison ablieferten, reichte es leider nicht – beide Spiele wurden knapp in drei Sätzen verloren. Souverän hingegen das Damendoppel: Zita Banhegyi / Miriam Gruber schafften mit ihren Sieg den Anschluss. Wie schon in den letzten Jahren musste sich Promiz Flis gegen seinen Angstgegner Lukas Rebhandl geschlagen geben und auch Erik Seiwald konnte abermals sein Potential nicht ausschöpfen. Zwar konnten Miriam Gruber und Dominik Kronsteiner mit ihren Zweisatzsiegen nochmals für Spannung sorgen – letztlich gab es aber eine unglückliche 3 : 5 Niederlage.<br>„Es lief alles auf ein 4 : 4 hin, doch in den entscheidenden Phasen waren wir nicht gerade die Glücklichsten,“ sah UBC Obmann Harald Starl ein Spiel auf Augenhöhe.<br>In der Rückrunde (Start: 9.

Der großartige Kampfgeist und natürlich auch ein Quäntchen Glück entschieden die Partie mit 5:3 zugunsten der Gastgeber.<br>Der BC Raiffeisen Alkoven setzte sich von Beginn an in Führung. Die beiden Herrendoppel verliefen auf hohem Niveau und extrem spannend. Letztendlich konnten die Alkovener Duos ihre Gegner jeweils im 3.Satz biegen und fixierten die 2:0 Führung. Das Damendoppel ging zwar verloren, dann spielten aber Lukas Rebhandl und Thomas Hahn groß auf. Sie brachten Alkoven durch ihre Siege mit großartigen kämpferischen und taktischen Leistungen mit 4:1 in Führung. Maria Steinmann und Christoph Lessl lieferten zwar tolle Spiele, mussten sich aber ihren stark spielenden Gegnern beugen.<br>Mit ihrem letzten Trumpf fixierte der BC Raiffeisen Alkoven den knappen Sieg. Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl siegten im abschließenden Mixed.<br>Teamleaderin Iris Freimüller war nach dem erfolgreichen Match glücklich.  „Die Meisterschaft ist bisher unseren Möglichkeiten entsprechend verlaufen.

Da Alkoven vor allem in den Doppelspielen große Qualität aufbietet, brauchen die Vorchdorfer gerade in ihrer Problemdisziplin ein Erfolgserlebnis, um das gesteckte Ziel erreichen zu können.</p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion]</p>","2015-12-04","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-2-Bundesliga/5ba00397a3683.png","5");

Die 4 OÖ-Vereine Askö Traun, BC Raiffeisen Alkoven, UBC Vorchdorf und Union Ohlsdorf kämpften dabei um wichtige Punkte für das Aufstiegs-Play-Off. Es waren knappe und spannende Spiele/Derby’s bei denen sich schlussendlich die Favoriten knapp durchsetzen konnten. Nachfolgend die Pressemitteilungen der Vereine.</p><p><strong>BC Raiffeisen Alkoven</strong><br>„<em>Am Samstag war wie erwartet gegen Traun nichts zu holen. Trotz tapferer Gegenwehr gab es eine 2:6 Niederlage. Wegen einer Krankheit konnte die Teamleaderin Iris Freimüller nicht antreten. Daher kam es zum Comeback ihrer älteren Schwester Tina Füreder. Sie überraschte alle und holte mit routiniertem Spiel gemeinsam mit Maria Steinmann im Damendoppel und mit Simon Rebhandl im Mixed die beiden Punkte für Alkoven.<br> Spannend verlief dann am Sonntag das Spiel beim Tabellennachbarn Union Vorchdorf. Nach starken Leistungen und spannenden Spielen konnte ein 5:3 Sieg gefeiert werden. Die beiden Herrendoppel und die Einzel von Lukas Rebhandl und Harald Hochgatterer wurden mit großem Kampfgeist gewonnen. Der Sieg von Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl im abschließenden Mixed entschied die Partie zu unseren Gunsten. Mit diesem Erfolg dürfte auch der dritte Tabellenplatz sicher sein.</em>“, so Manager Fritz Freimüller. </p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf</strong><br><em>„Gäbe es einen Bewerb für das Verlieren enger Spiele, wären wir Weltmeister. Das haben wir an diesem Wochenende gegen Vorchdorf und Feldkirch wieder eindrucksvoll bewiesen. Aber wir haben noch zweimal die Gelegenheit zu punkten und die Entscheidung muss ohnehin in der nächsten Runden gegen Klosterneuburg fallen. Darauf werden wir uns mit unserem jungen Team gewissenhaft vorbereiten.“</em>, so Sepp Retschitzegger.</p><p><strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong><br>Es war der erwartete Fight auf Augenhöhe: Das Derby Ohlsdorf gegen Vorchdorf war abermals ein Kampf auf Biegen und Brechen. Zwar ging die Heimmannschaft mit 1 : 0 in Front, ehe Dominik Kronsteiner / Primoz Flis in einer hartumkämpften Dreisatzpartie für den Ausgleich sorgten und Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi das UBC-Team erstmals in Front brachten. Noch einmal kam Ohlsdorf heran – Berger besiegte Seiwald in zwei Sätzen – ehe Primoz Flis im Topeinzel die Oberhand behielt.<br>Zuletzt musste sich Miriam Gruber zweimal in Folge gegen Katharina Hochmeier geschlagen geben. Doch zur rechten Zeit gelang der Ex-Staatsmeisterin aus Vorchdorf die Revanche – Gruber siegte mit 21:13, 22:20 und brachte damit das UBC Team mit 4 : 2 in Front. Nachdem das Mixed nach einer regelrechten „Berg- und Talfahrt“ in drei Sätzen an Ohlsdorf ging, musste abermals UBC-Oldie Peter Moritz all seine Routine und Können aufbieten, um Lukas Fröhlich mit 14:21, 21:18, 21:17 zu besiegen und UBC Vorchdorf einen hauchdünnen 5 : 3 Derbysieg bescherte.<br>„<em>Ein Derbysieg gibt immer wieder Grund zur besonderen Freude</em>“, zeigte sich UBC-Obmann Harald Starl mehr als zufrieden, dass sein Team auch trotz unsportlicher Störversuchen von den Zuschauerrängen die Nerven behielten.<br>Im zweiten Spiel der Doppelrunde musste sich das UBC Team gegen Alkoven wie in den letzten vier Begegnungen mit 3 : 5 geschlagen geben. „<em>Es wird Zeit, dass wir gegen Alkoven auch mal die engen Partien gewinnen</em>“, muss Starl und sein Team weiter auf einen Erfolg gegen Alkoven warten. Wie zuletzt gingen beide Herren Doppel an die Gäste und Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi feierten einen klaren Sieg im Damendoppel. Danach verlor Flis sein Einzel gegen Angstgegner Rebhandl in zwei Sätzen und Miriam Gruber feierte einen ebenso klaren Sieg im Dameneinzel. Mit enormer Kampfkraft konnte Peter Moritz sein Einzel mit 15:21, 21:18, 24:22 gegen Hahn gewinnen und den Ausgleich erzielen. Nachdem sich Dominik Kronsteiner und Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi jeweils in zwei Sätzen geschlagen geben musste ging der Sieg mit 5 : 3 an Alkoven.<br>Zwei Punkte wurden seitens UBC Vorchdorf für die Doppelrunde eingeplant und letztlich auch erreicht. „<em>Somit ist der Klassenerhalt vorzeitig geschafft</em>“, und Vorchdorf bleibt ein weiteres Jahr in der Badminton Bundesliga.</p><p><strong>Askö Traun</strong><br>Der Askö Traun ist seiner Favoritenrolle bei der Bundesliga-Doppelrunde am vergangenen Wochenende gerecht geworden und konnte gegen BC Alkoven (6:2) und im Heimspiel gegen Klosterneuburg (7:1) klare Siege einfahren. Damit hat sich das Team bereits vorzeitig für die Aufstiegsspiele in die 1. Bundesliga qualifiziert und hält bei einer makellosen Bilanz von 8 Siegen aus 8 Spielen.<br>Bereits am Samstag in Alkoven hat sich die gute Mischung aus Jugend und Routine wieder bewährt. Einzig im Damendoppel und Mixeddoppel konnten die Gastgeber punkten. Auch beim Heimspiel gegen Klosterneuburg zeigten sich die TraunerInnen gut gelaunt und sorgten für klare Spielgewinne. Die Abschlusspartie von Jakob Ostermann sorgte noch einmal für Spannung, Jakob setzte sich in einem Dreisatzkrimi durch.</p><p><a href=\"http://tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=3BC7846C-E2AD-43B6-9537-78AD83EB3B09&draw=2\"><em><strong>Hier gehts zu den Ergebnissen!</strong></em></a></p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion]</p>","2016-01-31","/content/news/2-Bundesliga-Knappe-Siege-der-Favoriten/5ba00465a6bb8.png","3");

OÖ-Vertreter BSC 70 Linz steht dabei zur Zeit auf dem aussichtsreichen 4. Tabellenplatz und wird versuchen diesen über das Wochenende zu verteidigen. Nachfolgend die Pressemitteilung des BSC 70 Linz von Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger:</p><p><strong>Ausgangslage</strong><br>Nach dem 4:4 Unentschieden gegen Meister Mödling in der letzten Runde will man an die Leistung anschließen. Die Mannschaft kann in der derzeit kompletten Formation, die auch gegen Mödling tolles Badminton bot, wieder antreten. Für den BSC 70 Linz geht es am Samstag gegen Verfolger Klagenfurt und Sonntags gegen den Tabellen zweiten Pressbaum. Brisant bzw. vorentscheidend für den weiteren Verlauf sind die Begegnungen sämtlicher Teams an diesem Wochenende. BSC 70 Linz könnte am Samstag mit einem Sieg den Verfolger Klagenfurt abschütteln, Pressbaum (Tabellen 2.) spielt gegen Wolfurt (Tabellen 3.); Wien fordert Tabellenführer Mödling. Hier könnte man bereits an, bei günstigen Verlauf, auf den Dritten Wolfurt aufschließen.<br>Am Sonntag spitzt sich das Ganze weiter zu… Wenn Mödling dieses Mal komplett antritt, sollte, mit einem Sieg, der Abstand zu Klagenfurt vergrößert werden können. Wien könnte zu Hause ein Stolperstein für die Wolfurter werden, zumal die Heimstärke von Wien über Jahre bekannt ist. Nicht zu unterschätzen wird das Spiel Pressbaum – Linz; die Niederlage aus der Hinrunde (bei vielen Ausfällen) will der BSC 70 Linz auswärts wieder gut machen.</p><p><strong>Unser Kader</strong><br>Unsere Mannschaft muss weiterhin auf den verletzten Vitaliy Konov verzichten, geht aber sonst mit kompletten Kader in das Spiel gegen Mödling.<br>Vor allem Elisabeth Baldauf (Österreichs Nr. 1 bei den Damen, sowie heißerste Aktie auf die Teilnahme für Rio 2016) wird auch an diesem Wochenende im Kader dabei sein.<br>Lisi Baldauf wird, nach der überraschenden Niederlage in Mödling, sicher heiß auf Wiedergutmachung sein. Dieses Feuer wird uns hoffentlich auch diesmal den nötigen Auftrieb geben. </p><p><em>„Wir erwarten ein heißes Badminton Wochenende wo wieder Kleinigkeiten über den Ausgang der Begegnungen entscheiden werden. Mit Sicherheit wird das Team des BSC 70 Linz alles geben um den Play-off Platz bereits dieses Wochen zu fixieren. Zwei Siege an diesem Wochenende würde, zwei Runden vor Schluss, die Teilnahme am Play-off fixieren. Unser Team wird alles geben und die Fans werden wieder Badminton vom Feinsten sehen.“</em>, freut sich Obmann Reinhard Hechenberger auf viele Badminton Leckerbissen.</p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion, BSC 70 Linz]</p>","2016-01-28","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-1-Bundesliga/5ba0055241ab3.png","3");

Während Primoz Flis das Topeinzel klar verlor, kämpften Erik Seiwald und Dominik Kronsteiner aufopfernd – letztlich mussten sich beide in jeweils drei Sätzen geschlagen geben.

Beide Mannschaften mussten leider auf Stammspieler Innen verzichten. Matchwinner waren einerseits unsere Routiniers Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner, die Ihre  4 Spiele gewinnen konnten. Die Beiden sind eine unverzichtbare Basis für einen Erfolg.  Anderseits überraschte das jugendliches Damen- Doppel Laura Hauser / Lena Zinganell mit einem klaren 2 Satz- Sieg gegen das favorisierte Duo Hochmeir/ Fröhlich aus Ohlsdorf. Die Trauner innen, beide Schülerinnen des Leistungs- Borgs- Linz, spielten bei dieser Begegnung wahrscheinlich ihr bestes Match und zeigten eine deutliche Niveausteigerung.<br> In der Doppelrunde am 30. und 31.Jänner gegen BC Alkoven und Klosterneuburg wird sicher eine Vorentscheidung um die Aufstiegs- Play Off- Plätze fallen.</em>          </p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion]</p>","2016-01-10","/content/news/2-Bundesliga-Favoriten-setzen-sich-knapp-durch/5ba006f855fa4.png","3");

Jän. 2016 (15 Uhr Sporthalle) in die Rückrunde der Badminton Bundesliga.<br>Obwohl die Vorchdorfer das Auswärtsspiel mit 1 : 7 verloren, zählen die UBC-ler zu den Angstgegner der Vorarlberger. „Ein Unentschieden wäre für uns aber schon ein Gewinn,“ bleibt UBC Obmann Harald Starl bescheiden. Feldkirch konnte sich heuer mit zwei jungen slovenischen Spielern optimal verstärken und zählt nach wie vor zu den Aufstiegskandidaten.<br>Für Vorchdorf ist die Situation wie eh und je: Punkten bei den Doppelspielen. „Das wird speziell gegen die Spieler aus dem Ländle extrem schwierig,“ weiß Starl.</p><p><strong>ASKÖ Traun: </strong><br>ASKÖ Traun wird sein Heimspiel gegen die Union Ohlsdorf dieses Mal in der Sporthalle im Bundesschulzentrum austragen und versuchen, die Tabellenführung  zu verteidigen.<br>Manager Koch Herbert meint vor dem Derby:<br>„Dass wir für dieses Mal von der Stadionhalle in die Halle im Bundesschulzentrum ausweichen müssen ist eher ein Vorteil. In dieser Halle trainieren wir die meiste Zeit und unsere Sportlerinnen und Sportler finden sich hier sehr gut zurecht. Das Spiel gegen die Junge Mannschaft aus dem Salzkammergut wird sicher nicht leicht und wir sollten  auf dem Weg zum Erreichen des Aufstiegs-Play off nicht verlieren. Wir haben in den Ferien sehr gut trainiert und gehen gut vorbereitet in die Begegnung. Unsere Gegner werden sicher einige Zuschauer mitbringen, wodurch die Stimmung in der Halle sicher gut sein wird.“</p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion]</p>","2016-01-07","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-2-Bundesliga/5ba007f70b496.png","8");

Runde ergibt, dass die 4 Meister-Play-off Mannschaften feststehen, aber praktisch in der letzten Runde erst die endgültigen Paarungen im Halbfinale entschieden werden. Auch hier bringt die Auslosung der Spielansetzungen absolute Spannung. BSC 70 Linz muss in Wolfurt ran, Pressbaum in Mödling und Wien in Kärnten.“</em> freut sich ein stolzer Obmann über den 2. Platz in der Tabelle.</p><p>Ohne den für ihn wohl notwendigen Druck spielte Miha an diesem Wochenende etwas unglücklich und hatte in der entscheidenden Phase nicht das richtige Rezept. Das Damendoppel verlor, auch diesmal wieder einmal in 3 Sätzen, gegen das gut agierende Wiener Doppel. Wieder einmal sehr sehenswert die Vorstellung von Wolfgang Gnedt, der in der Rückrunde einen weiteren Schritt in der Entwicklung genommen hat. Er ließ Lukas Weißenbäck keine Chance und gewann souverän in 2 Sätzen. Ebenso die Leistung von Miha Ivanic im 3. Einzel, der über weite Strecken des Spiels Katz und Maus mit dem Gegner spielte. Zu dominant war sein Spiel an diesem Tag. Im abschließenden Mixed kam noch einmal etwas Spannung auf, als unsere Paarung bereits etwas an Konzentration verlor. Schlussendlich blieb sie mit dem 2 Satz-Sieg weiterhin ohne Niederlage.</p><p>[Bericht: BSC 70 Linz, Reinhard Hechenberger]</p>","2016-02-14","/content/news/1-Bundesliga-ndash-BSC-70-Linz-siegt/5ba00f210adc8.png","5");

Askö Traun konnte mit einem 4:4 Unentschieden gegen UBC Vorchdorf den Meistertitel in der 2. Bundesliga fixieren. Auch dem BC Feldkirch genügte ein 4:4 gegen den BC Raiffeisen Alkoven, um den zweiten Platz zu sichern. Überraschend deutlich fiel das Duell der beiden Nachzügler Union Ohlsdorf gegen Union Racketlon Klosterneuburg aus. Die Ohlsdorfer siegten mit 7:1 und konnten mit diesen 2 Punkten wieder an den Klosterneuburgern in der Tabelle vorbeiziehen. Ohlsdorf liegt daher eine Runde vor Schluss einen Punkt vor Klosterneuburg. Im Anschluss die Pressemitteilungen der Vereine.</p><p><strong>UBC Vorchdorf</strong><br>Gegen Angstgegner ASKÖ Traun ist ein Punktgewinn wie ein Sieg: UBC Vorchdorf knüpfte dem Leader beim 4 : 4 Unentschieden den ersten Punkteverlust ab. Dabei begann für die Vorchdorfer das Spiel alles andere als optimal, nachdem beide Herrendoppel klar an Koch & Co. gingen. Eine Siegbank sind derzeit die UBC Ladies. Die Vizestaatsmeisterinnen Zita Bahnhegyi / Miriam Gruber siegten klar mit 21:7, 21:9. Gegen die beiden Ex-Internationalen Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner hatten die Vorchdorfer Primoz Flis und Erik Seiwald wenig entgegen zu setzen – beide verloren klar mit 0 : 2 Sätzen. Traun führte somit mit 4 : 1. Nun ging ein regelrechter Ruck durch das UBC Team. Obwohl Dominik Kronsteiner, Miriam Gruber und Manuel Weber / Zita Banhegyi ihre Eröffnungssätze verloren, stemmten sich alle gegen die drohende Niederlage und drehten die Matches zu drei wohl unerwarteten Dreisatzsiegen und fixierten damit das 4 : 4 Unentschieden.<br><em>„Ein Punktegewinn gegen Traun ist wie ein Sieg,“ </em>strahlte UBC Obmann Harald Starl, nachdem sein Team den neuen Meister den ersten Punkteverlust zugefügt hatte. </p><p><strong>BC Raiffeisen Alkoven</strong><br>Zum entscheidenden Spiel um den Einzug in das Aufstiegs-Play-Off musste der BC Raiffeisen Alkoven nach Feldkirch (Vbg) reisen. Noch am Freitagabend war für Teammanager Fritz Freimüller nicht klar, welche Mannschaft zur Verfügung stehen würde. Iris Freimüller und Maria Steinmann mussten krankheitsbedingt das Bett hüten. Erst kurz vor der Abreise entschieden sich die beiden Damen für einen Start.Die Gastgeber aus dem Ländle gingen als klarer Favorit an den Start, dementsprechend gut war auch die Stimmung in der Halle. Diese wurde aber bereits nach den Siegen der beiden Alkovener Herrendoppel Thomas Hahn/Simon Rebhandl und Christoph Lessl/Lukas Rebhandl gedämpft.<br>Dann kämpften die beiden geschwächten Damen zwar tapfer, es fehlte aber in den entscheidenden Phasen auch noch das Glück. Iris und Maria verloren ihr Doppel ganz knapp 22:24 und 17:21. Leider gingen dann die Einzel von Maria Steinmann, Lukas Rebhandl und Thomas Hahn verloren und damit sicherten sich die Feldkircher den Play-Off-Platz. Siege durch Christoph Lessl und das Mixed Iris Freimüller/Simon Rebhandl stellten den Endstand von 4:4 her.<br>Dieses Unentschieden wurde vom Alkovener Team als Erfolg gewertet, immerhin war es der erste Punktegewinn in Vorarlberg. Außerdem wurde das Saisonziel mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz in der 2.Bundeliga bestätigt.</p><p><strong>Askö Traun</strong><br>Mit dem Unentschieden haben wir den Meistertitel in der 2. Bundesliga vorzeitig fixiert. Damit haben wir das 1. Ziel erreicht und können bei den Aufstiegsspielen 2x in unserer Halle antreten. Gegen Vorchdorf waren wieder einmal unsere Staatsmeister Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner die Gewinner der erforderlichen  Punkte.  In der letzten Runde und bei den Play off Spielen können wir wieder auf unsere Verstärkung aus Indonesien, Meisy Jolly Lee zurückgreifen. Wir freuen uns auf die Aufstiegsspiele, wenngleich wir wissen, dass das Erreichen der 1. Bundesliga ganz schwer wird.<br><em>Wir müssen uns auf die 3 Begegnungen gegen WBH Wien, ASKÖ Klagenfurt und BC Feldkirch gewissenhaft vorbereiten. Mit einer sehr guten Leistung können wir eventuell eine Überraschung liefern.</em></p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf</strong><br>Diesmal haben wir mit einem klaren Erfolg gegen Klosteneuburg endlich den ersten Sieg in dieser Saison geschafft. Der Blumengruß  zum Valentinstag an die Damen waren die einzigen Geschenke, die wir verteilt haben. Letztendlich waren die Spiele aber doch sehr spannend und die Klosteneuburger haben sich kräftig gewehrt. Mit Hilfe von Trainer Manuel Rösler konnten wir uns gründlich auf dieses entscheidende Spiel vorbereiten und wir haben in den knappen Partien die Nerven behalten. Es war aber nur ein Schritt zum Klassenerhalt, gerettet sind wir noch immer nicht. Viel hängt von der letzten Runde ab, ob Klosterneuburg in Vorchdorf noch einmal punkten kann.</p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion]</p>","2016-02-14","/content/news/2-Bundesliga-ndash-Traun-fixiert-Meistertitel/5ba00f4090ae5.png","4");

Wie am Wochenende bei den Staatsmeisterschaften, hoffen wir vor allem auf die gute Form unserer Doppel- Staatsmeister Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner. Wir wollen die makellose Bilanz gegen Vorchdorf verlängern, wenngleich vor allem die Damen aus dem Salzkammergut bei den Staatsmeisterschaften gute Form bewiesen haben. </p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf</strong><br>Nach den zuletzt jeweils knappen Niederlagen und dem derzeit letzten Tabellenrang steht unsere junge Mannschaft natürlich unter Zugzwang.

Erst das bessere Satzverhältnis entschied das Spiel zugunsten von Wolfurt.</p><p><strong>Folgend der Bericht des BSC 70 Linz: </strong></p><p>Die Enttäuschung kurz nach dem Spiel ist enorm – eine extrem enge und spannende Begegnung mit dem besseren Ende für Wolfurt. Nach 3,5 Stunden Kampf war der Krimi zu Ende. Die ganze Mannschaft ist sehr traurig – das Team hat toll gekämpft aber in der entscheidenden Phase nicht die nötige Coolness gehabt. Wir trauern einigen Spielen nach, aber so ist der Sport. Es war toller Sport den die zahlreichen Zuseher in der AHS Solar City gesehen haben. Beide Teams waren sehr fair.</p><p><strong>Statement des Obmann des BSC 70 Linz</strong><br>Hätte, wenn und wäre.. zählt leider nichts. Mit Ausfall von Vitaliy Konov (Kreuzbandriss) und weiterer gesundheitlichen Problemen mancher Spieler zur Play-off time mussten wir unsere sportlichen Möglichkeiten zurückschrauben. Dass die Nr.1 bei den Damen und Herren in ihren Paradedisziplinen gar nicht antreten können verkraftet keine Mannschaft auf diesem Niveau. Dennoch, wir haben als MANNSCHAFT, die wir sind, alle an den Erfolg geglaubt. Diejenigen die die Verantwortung übernahmen haben alles gegeben. Es war toller Sport den die zahlreichen Zuseher in der AHS Solar City gesehen haben. „Game of the day“ war auf jeden Fall das Damen Doppel und wird daher auch hier extra erwähnt. An Dramatik und Spannung war dieses Spiel nicht zu überbieten. Es war tolle Werbung für den Sport.</p><p><strong>DANKE…</strong><br>Danke an alle Sponsoren und Förderer sowie der öffentlichen Hand die es uns überhaupt ermöglichen unseren Sport auf diesem Niveau ausüben zu lassen.</p><p><strong>Zukunft…</strong><br>Für den BSC 70 Linz gilt jetzt für die neue Saison zu planen. Definitiv wird der BSC 70 Linz in der kommenden Saison in der 1. Bundesliga antreten und verlängert damit die Serie der Bundesligazughörigkeit auf 45 Jahre. (1972-1977 Staatsliga B; ab 1977 in Staatsliga A/1. Bundesliga). Kein einziger Verein in Österreich kann das von sich behaupten. Also liebe Kritiker und Besserwisser; zuerst mal so was schaffen und dann reden.</p><p><strong>Farewell…</strong><br>Im Zuge der obligatorischen Abschlussbesprechung bedankte sich die Vereinsführung bei allen Sportlerinnen und Sportlern für die abgelaufene Saison. Olympiahoffnung Elisabeth Baldauf wird leider definitiv nach dieser Saison den BSC 70 Linz wieder Richtung Ausland verlassen. Wir wünschen Ihr für die Olympiaquali weiterhin alles Gute und der BSC 70 Linz hat seinen Teil dazu beigetragen, dass Lisi den „Weg nach Rio“ gehen kann. Die von anderen Vereinen umworbenen Sportlerinnen und Sportler werden wir versuchen zu halten und gemeinsam mit dem Stamm der Mannschaft weitermachen. Zu Ende ist aber auch die Bundesligakoordination durch Reinhard Hechenberger. Nach 15 Jahren ist es Zeit für neuen Schwung in der 1. Mannschaft zu sorgen; das Tagesgeschäft und die Betreuung der Mannschaft bei den Spielen wird in neue Hände gegeben.</p><p>Das Bundesligateam des BSC 70 Linz gratuliert Wolfurt zum Finaleinzug.</p><p>[Bericht: BSC 70 Linz]</p>","2016-04-11","/content/news/1-Bundesliga-Play-Off-ndash-BSC-70-Linz-verliert-gegen-Wolfurt/5ba1491c78aae.png","3");

Mit dem Heimvorteil kann die Serie damit eventuell noch gedreht werden. Nachfolgend der Pressebericht des BSC 70 Linz:</p><p>Die Vorzeichen für die heutige Partie in der Badminton Bundesliga waren äußerst vielversprechend. Das Team hatte sich mit einem guten Grunddurchgang eine hervorragende Ausgangsposition geschaffen.</p><p>Doch es kam ganz anders…:<br>Am Tag vor dem heutigen Match meldet sich leider Wolfgang Gnedt mit Viruserkrankung ab. Ebenso fehlt Miha Ivanic (er spielte, wegen U19 EM Qualifikation, in Italien ein Internationales Turnier). Die Nr. 8 der Jugendweltrangliste war bei diesem Turnier auch an Nr. 1 gesetzt und seine Teilnahme an der Bundesliga war nicht geplant. Dass aber mit Wolfgang und seinem Bruder Rüdiger Gnedt ein weiterer Spieler ausfällt, ist sehr dramatisch. Damit fallen mit Wolfgang Gnedt und Miha Ivanic 2 junge, starke Sportler aus. Damit bekam U22 Doppel Staatsmeister Daniel Walchshofer seine verdiente Chance in einem so wichtigem Match anzutreten. Schlussendlich hätte auch der Obmann des BSC 70 Linz zum Racket greifen müssen um eine komplette Mannschaft zu stellen. Dazu kam es nicht mehr. Die Begegnung wurde bei 4:2 für Wolfurt abgebrochen, nachdem das Damen Einzel (Kondric gg. Baldauf) mit 1:2 Sätzen an Baldauf ging. Damit hat Wolfurt selbst bei einem 4:4 einen Satz mehr gewonnen und steht als Sieger fest. Etwas überraschend die Niederlage von Miha Sepec gegen Jan Sedlmayr in 2 Sätzen. Dennoch gaben wir vor der Begegnung noch nicht ganz die Hoffnung nach einer Überraschung auf. Der Matchplan mit Lisi Baldauf (Stärkste Dame der Liga und Olympiaqualifikationshoffnung) wäre mit 3 gewonnen Damenspielen noch immer realistisch. Aus den Herrenspielen war mindestens ein Sieg notwendig. Selbst mit einen 4:4 unentschieden und der besseren Satzdifferenz hätte man das 1. Halbfinale noch, nach den Regeln, gewonnen gehabt.</p><p>Nun müssen wir auf das Rückspiel in 1 Woche hoffen. Wir werden uns mit Sicherheit nicht hängen lassen und versuchen die Best of three Play-offs in der eigenen Halle noch zu drehen.<br>Sollten wir am Samstag 9.4., 15 Uhr in der AHS Solar City Halle gewinnen können wird das Entscheidungsspiel am Sonntag 10.4, 11 Uhr (ebenfalls in Linz) ausgetragen  </p><p><strong>Kommentar des Obmanns Reinhard Hechenberger:</strong><br>„<em>Die Wolfurter Halle war sehr gut besucht.

Bei der Eröffnung der Veranstaltung durch Trauns Sportreferent Franz Amann, ÖBV-Präsident Harald Starl und OÖBV-Präsident Herbert Koch wurde auf die zunehmende Bedeutung von derartigen Events hingewiesen. Die gestiegene Lebenserwartung begründet sich auch dadurch, dass der Seniorensport immer mehr Interesse erfährt und die ältere Generation fit hält.</p><p>Das Besondere bei diesem Turnier war allerdings nicht nur die sportliche Auseinandersetzung.

Es  war das erste Mal, dass ein Regio-Training in Alkoven stattfand. Insgesamt aus 6 Vereinen waren Spieler entsandt worden, nämlich: Askö Linz, BC Alkoven, Union Altmünster, BC Windischgarsten, BC Seekirchen und Post SV Salzburg.</p><p>Nach einem ausgiebigem Aufwärmen wurde an der Griffhaltung und an der Beinarbeit ins Vorderfeld gearbeitet. Natürlich mit den Schwerpunkten Ausfallschritt und Auftakt. Auch am kurzen Rückhandaufschlag wurde gearbeitet. Danach wurden Matchrunden gespielt, und schon bald danach die verdiente Pause genossen.Im zweiten Training wurde an den Inhalten vom ersten Training weiter gearbeitet. Jetzt lag der Fokus mehr auf dem Schläger und natürlich dem beschleunigendem Element dieser Schläge, nämlich dem Unterarm. Passend dazu wurde auch das lange Vorhandservice geübt und verbessert. Und abschließend wurde wieder eine Matchrunde gespielt.</p><p>Ein besonderes Dankeschön an Werner Nußdorfer, Ulrich Stoiber, Iris Freimüller, Jakob Achleitner Simonsen und Peter Schwarzmann, die uns unterstützt haben. </p><p>Das war das vorletzte Regionaltraining der Saison.

Am Sonntag mußte dann teilweise in sehr knappen Partien wieder im letzten Spiel – dem Mixed – die Entscheidung  ( 3:2) gegen Graz für Ohlsdorf fallen.

Satz für Ohlsdorf.</p><p>Für Michael Schausberger war es nach dem Sieg vor zwei Wochen beim internationalen Turnier in Waghäusl ( GER) ein gelungener Abschluss seiner Jugendkarriere – muss er doch nächstes Jahr aufgund des Alters in die allgemeine Klasse wechseln.

Bundesliga-Club Union Ohlsdorf geführt.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Wann hast Du mit dem Badmintonsport angefangen? Kannst Du uns etwas über deine ersten Erfahrungen erzählen? </em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Mit 9 Jahren habe ich mit dem Badmintonsport angefangen. Durch den Ohlsdorfer Trainer Josef Retschitzegger der damals den „Girls Day“ veranstaltete, kam ich das erste Mal mit Badminton in Berührung und war sofort begeistert davon. Am Anfang war es ein sehr schwieriger Sport für mich, da ich im Gegensatz zu den anderen kaum die Bälle traf. Mit der Zeit wurde es immer besser und ich fand immer mehr Spaß und Freude daran.</p><p>badminton-ooe.at:<em> Du bist seit Jahren erfolgreiche Nachwuchsspielerin, woher nimmst Du deine Motivation?</em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> In erster Linie nehme ich die Motivation von mir selbst, weil ich immer besser werden möchte und mich von nichts unterkriegen lasse. Der zweite wichtige Punkt ist, dass uns auch unser Trainer sehr gut motivieren kann und meine Teamkollegen mit denen ich gemeinsam trainiere. Alleine der Spaß am Training ist etwas ganz Wichtiges um immer weiter zu machen.</p><p>badminton-ooe.at: <em>Letztes Jahr lief es in der 2. Bundesliga nicht optimal für das Ohlsdorfer Team. Wie hat sich einerseits der Kampf um den Abstieg angefühlt und wie groß war die Erleichterung nach dem geschafften Klassenerhalt? </em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Für uns als Team war es eine extreme Belastung, da wir auf keinen Fall absteigen wollten. Das letzte Spiel war mit großen Ängsten verbunden. Als wir das 4:4 gegen den damaligen Gegner Alkoven erreichten, das uns den Klassenerhalt sicherte, waren wir extrem erleichtert und freuten uns auf ein weiteres Jahr in der 2. Bundesliga. Es war uns eine große Lehre und wir möchten nicht mehr um den Klassenerhalt kämpfen müssen.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Gibt es bei euch Abgänge/Neuzugänge?</em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Nein, die Mannschaftsmitglieder bleiben die gleichen wie im letzten Jahr.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Auch wichtig für die Bundesliga: Siehst Du dich mehr im Einzel, Doppel oder Mixed, beziehungsweise was spielst du am liebsten/besten?</em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Ich sehe mich wie in den letzten Jahren, eher im Mixed und Doppel, weil dort auch bei den anderen Turnieren meine Stärken liegen. Am liebsten spiele ich Mixed mit meinem Partner Michael Schausberger, mit dem ich schon seit Anfang an spiele und trainiere. Wir sind in den letzten Jahren ein sehr starkes Team geworden, was man auch bei den Ergebnissen vom letzten Jahr sieht.</p><p>badminton-ooe.at: <em>Was sind deine Ziele für die nächste Saison? </em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Natürlich möchte ich in der Bundesliga bestmögliche Leistungen erbringen. Da es heuer mein letztes Jahr in der U19 ist, möchte ich noch möglichst viele Stockerlplätze bei den österreichischen Meisterschaften und mir damit einige Medaillen sichern. Ein weiteres meiner Ziele ist es meinen A-Ranglistenplatz zu verbessern.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Manche SpielerInnen haben jedes Jahr gleiche Abläufe im Sommertraining. Wie trainierst Du? Fährst Du immer auf das gleiche Trainingslager, oder planst Du jeden Sommer neu?</em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Normalerweise trainiert uns Josef Retschitzegger den ganzen Sommer lang und wir fuhren auf das Andorfer Trainingslager. Doch dieses Jahr ist es anders, weil unser Trainer fast den ganzen Sommer auf Reisen ist und das Andorf-Camp leider nicht zustande kommt. Daher übernimmt dieses Jahr Michael Schausberger die Organisation des Sommer-Trainings, 4-5 Mal pro Woche. Zusätzlich holen wir uns Manuel Rösler, der ansonsten das Training beim Andorf-Camp leitet, eine Woche zu uns nach Ohlsdorf. Wir möchten uns dadurch wieder bestmöglich auf die kommende Saison vorbereiten.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong><em> Elisabeth Baldauf wird Österreich in Rio im Dameneinzel vertreten, wäre das auch ein Ziel für dich? Wie denkst Du wird sie sich schlagen und wer gewinnt deiner Meinung nach den Dameneinzeltitel?</em></p><p><strong>Nadine Reiter:</strong> Es ist natürlich für jede begeisterte Badmintonspielerin ein Traum bei den Olympischen Spielen teilzunehmen, aber dorthin schaffen es wirklich nur die Allerbesten. Da ich nach meiner Hak-Matura plane zu studieren, glaube ich nicht die nötige Zeit für das intensive Training, welches für eine Olympiateilnahme notwendig ist, aufbringen zu können.<br>Ich drücke Elisabeth Baldauf die Daumen, dass sie es möglichst weit nach oben schafft. Ich tippe dieses Jahr auf Carolin Marin, weil sie körperlich extrem fit und durchtrainiert ist und mit ihrem vollen Einsatz, ihrer Motivation und ihrem riesigen Ehrgeiz die wichtigen Spiele für sich entscheiden kann.</p><p>[Bericht: Lukas Rebhandl – Redaktion]</p>","2016-08-18","/content/news/Interview-mit-Nadine-Reiter/5ba14cda4ba4d.png","9");

Man lernt auch als Trainer ständig dazu und findet neu Wege die Athleten ans Limit zu bringen. Wir haben am Olympiazentrum in Linz sehr gute Bedingungen und auch einen sehr guten Kontakt zu den anderen Sportarten und dem Team vom Olympiazentrum. Wir tauschen uns gegenseitig aus und ich kann von meiner Erfahrung als Spieler sagen, dass es hier in Linz wirklich möglich ist ein internationales Badminton Niveau zu erreichen.<br>Da ich nebenbei auch mein Studium abschließen möchte, ist es aber auch oft sehr stressig. Als junger Trainer versuche ich mich auch selber noch fit zu halten, um im Training öfter mitspielen zu können. Wenn man die Möglichkeit dazu hat, sollte man das auch nutzen. Man kann aktiv am Court teilweise viel mehr erreichen als nur von außen als Trainer.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Wie siehst du die Entwicklungen beim OÖBV/ÖBV – Worauf kommt es in nächster Zeit an?</em></p><p><strong>Peter Zauner: </strong> Aktuell habe ich eine Teilzeitanstellung beim OÖBV. Um noch professioneller arbeiten zu können, müssen wir eine Vollzeit-Stelle anstreben, damit ein Trainer auch wirklich eine Perspektive hat und vom Trainerjob leben kann. Beim OÖ-Tischtennis-Verband ist das der Fall, sie können sogar noch einen 2. Trainer 15-20h anstellen. Das sollte auch unser Ziel sein, denn dann kann man sich wirklich verbessern und professioneller arbeiten. Wir haben in den letzten Jahren versucht etwas Neues aufzubauen um in der Öffentlichkeit ein besseres Bild abzugeben. Das Sportland OÖ entwickelt gerade eine neue Sportstrategie bis 2025. Wir werden versuchen im Zuge dieser Neuausrichtung mehr Fördergelder zu bekommen, damit sich unsere Aufbauarbeit auch gelohnt hat und wir in Zukunft weniger improvisieren müssen. Dazu gehört auch, dass wir medial wieder präsenter werden und die OÖBV-Aktivitäten auf unserer Homepage www.badminton-ooe.at transparent dargestellt werden.<br>Weiters wird es sehr wichtig sein, wieder mehr Kinder zum Badminton zu bringen, sei es über die Schulen oder die Vereine. Als ich noch Nachwuchs-Spieler war, waren wir im Nachwuchs das stärkste Bundesland Österreichs. Um dort wieder hinzukommen müssen wir es gemeinsam schaffen, dass mehr Kinder, so oft wie möglich, ein Training mit hoher Qualität bekommen. In der heutigen Zeit ist es nicht mehr so einfach Kinder zu motivieren regelmäßig Sport zu betreiben. Es gibt einfach sehr viele Ablenkungen. Das berichten auch sehr viele Trainer von anderen Sportarten am Olympiazentrum. Da sollten wir uns überlegen wie wir dem entgegenwirken können.<br>Die Entwicklungen beim ÖBV sehe ich von 2 Seiten. Es wird sehr viel Gutes dafür getan neue Projekte zu installieren und dadurch die nötigen Gelder und Förderungen zu bekommen. Wir haben zum 2. Mal hintereinander Teilnehmer bei den Olympischen Spielen. Das ist eine positive Entwicklung. Die Anzahl der SpielerInnen in der Breite sowie in der Spitze wird jedoch nicht mehr. Wir sollten uns fragen, ob unsere jungen Talente genug Perspektiven haben, um Badminton wirklich als Leistungssport betreiben zu wollen? In den Einzeldisziplinen haben wir zwar einige SpielerInnen, die in der Weltrangliste eine gute Position haben aber das Spielniveau der österreichischen Spieler gegenüber früheren Generationen ist niedriger. Damit wir uns als Sportart weiterentwickeln, müssen wir hier ehrlich und genau analysieren. Wir haben keine Spieler mehr in den Top 50. Dazu müsste einfach das Spielniveau wieder höher werden. Das sollte an oberster Stelle stehen, der Rest kommt dann von alleine. Ob für das Erreichen der Top 50 in der Welt die Voraussetzungen und das Know-How vorhanden sind wage ich zu bezweifeln. Wenn wir wieder solche Top-Spieler als Vorbilder haben, ist es viel einfacher die jungen Sportler zu animieren, es auch zu versuchen. Das war auch mein Antrieb als junger Spieler. Ich wollte wissen wie weit ich in der Weltrangliste als Österreicher kommen kann.<br>Jetzt sollten wir uns vor allem auf die Olympischen Spiele freuen und mit unseren österreichischen Teilnehmern David Obernosterer und Elisabeth Baldauf mitfiebern.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Was sind die nächsten Maßnahmen beim OÖBV?</em></p><p><strong>Peter Zauner: </strong> Wir fahren im September mit der Leistungssportborg Gruppe und Kathi Hochmeir 2 Wochen auf ein Trainingslager nach China (Jinan), was für die jungen SportlerInnen ein Highlight ist. Der Trainingsaufenthalt kam durch eine Kooperation mit dem oberösterreichischen Tischtennisverband und dem Olympiazentrum in Linz zustande. Die Tischtennis-Spieler konnten schon letztes Jahr von den tollen Bedingungen im Trainingszentrum in Jinan profitieren. Diese Kooperation ist jetzt auch für uns möglich und wir bestreiten die Reise auch gemeinsam. Das gute daran ist, dass auch die chinesischen Spieler zu uns trainieren kommen. Das ist eine einmalige Gelegenheit, um sich verbessern zu können.<br>Auf dieses Trainingslager bereiten wir uns gerade vor, um so viel wie möglich aus den 2 Wochen mitnehmen zu können. Dort werden die Spieler sehen was wirklich nötig ist, um ein erfolgreicher Badminton Spieler zu werden. Mir haben diese Trainings- und Turnieraufenthalte in den führenden Badminton-Ländern der Welt immer eine riesige Motivation gegeben. Ich erwarte mir eigentlich schon, dass wir danach auch mit viel höherer Qualität in Österreich trainieren können.<br>Weiters haben wir von 5.-7. August einen OÖBV-Nachwuchskaderkurs auf der Linzer Gugl. Gemeinsam mit den Trainern Jürgen Koch und Yan Yujiang werden wir versuchen den Nachwuchssportlern zu zeigen, wie man die Qualität im Training verbessert und trotzdem Spaß dabei hat.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Wo wir gerade beim Training sind, kannst Du uns Tipps geben, wie man im Sommer, der Turnier-freien Zeit, trainieren sollte?</em></p><p><strong>Peter Zauner: </strong> Den Sommer sollte man immer dazu nutzen an der körperlichen Fitness zu arbeiten, um dann für die Saison gut vorbereitet zu sein. Je nach den individuellen körperlichen Fähigkeiten sollte man versuchen die eigenen Grundlagen zu verbessern.<br><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Eine persönliche Frage: Was machst du im Sommer abseits des Badminton-Courts?</em></p><p><strong>Peter Zauner: </strong> Ich war gerade 1 Woche auf Urlaub in Italien und genieße die studienfreie Zeit. Dazu versuche ich auch ein Aufbautraining zu machen im Sommer. Das tut mir sehr gut.</p><p><strong>badminton-ooe.at:</strong> <em>Nun zur letzten Frage: Als erfolgreicher Doppelspieler, wer denkst Du holt sich die Goldmedaille in Rio im Herren- bzw.

Und 25. September 2016 fand in Hohenems (Vorarlberg) das 1. A Ranglistenturnier der Saison 2016/2017 statt. Aufgrund des zeitgleich ausgetragenen internationalen Turniers in Polen war das A Turnier eher schlecht besucht (Herreneinzel nur 25 Teilnehmer; Dameneinzel 14 Teilnehmerinnen). <strong>12 SpielerInnen aus Oberösterreich</strong> stellten dabei einen großen Anteil am Teilnehmerfeld.</p><p>Das Turnier verlief für die OberösterreicherInnen sehr gut. Im Herreneinzel waren 4 der 8 Viertelfinalisten Oberösterreicher. Leider konnte sich dabei nur <strong>Florian Baumgartner</strong> (Union Ohlsdorf) durchsetzen. Er schaltete die Nummer 1 des Turniers Lukas Weissenbäck aus. Im Halbfinale bekam er es mit Rüdiger Gnedt zu tun. Baumgartner konnte dabei nicht mehr zulegen und verlor in 2 Sätzen. Trotzdem ist natürlich der 3. Platz für den an Nummer 9 gesetzten ein absoluter Erfolg. Den geteilten 5. Platz belegten Florian Brandstötter (UBC Vorchdorf) und Lukas Rebhandl (Union Windischgarsten). Auf dem 7. Platz landete Markus Ratzenböck (ASKÖ Traun). </p><p>Ebenfalls sehr erfreulich endete der Dameneinzelbewerb. Die an Nummer 12 gesetzte <strong>Jana Haas</strong> (Union Ohlsdorf) konnte sich bis ins Halbfinale spielen. Dort verlor sie leider gegen die später Siegerin Tina Kodric.

Um 8:15 gehen wir also los vom Hotel ins 5 Minten entfernte Olympiazentrum. Dort angekommen erwartet uns immer das selbe Aufwärmprogramm – zuerst dehnen, dann laufen. Danach erhalten wir Infos vom Trainer bezüglich des Trainings und dann legen wir los. Egal ob Techniktraining, Krafttraing, Lauftraining, oder normales Training in der Halle am Programm steht, wir müssen immer 100% geben und kämpfen. Die Trainingseinheiten dauern meist 3 Stunden und das 2 mal am Tag, eine wirklich lange Zeit, bei so einem intensivem Training und meist rund 30 Grad.  Man kann sich wirklich nicht vorstellen, wie lange 3 Stunden Training sein können. Es reicht auch nicht, wenn man nur ein oder zwei Trainingsshirts eingepackt hat, denn spätestens nach der ersten Übung kann man sein Shirt ausdrücken, weil man so viel Schwitzt.<br></em></p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</p>","2016-09-27","/content/news/Bericht-vom-OOEBV-Trainingslager-in-China/5ba14dc76f998.png","8");

Deswegen hat sich Peter Krenmayr die Mühe gemacht und die Teilnehmerdaten der letzten Jahre gesammelt und analysiert. Sein Ergebnis war eindeutig: In der Nordzone ist es zur Zeit nicht sinnvoll D-Turniere durchzuführen. Der ÖBV-Wettkampfausschuss hat daraufhin Peter Krenmayrs Antrag am 10.06. zugestimmt und die D-Turniere in der Nordzone gestrichen. Somit beginnt für alle Turnier-Neueinsteiger aus Salzburg und Oberösterreich die Rangliste mit den C-Turnieren.</p><p>Am 24.09. war es dann soweit. Das 1.C-Nord seit der Streichung der D-Turniere stand in Windischgarsten am Programm. Am Tag vor dem Nennschluss war der Höchststand mit 34 Herren erreicht. Beim Nennschluss waren es dann schließlich 33 Herren, 3 Damen, 2 Mixeddoppel und etliche Herrendoppelnennungen. Somit war klar, dass das Turnier an zwei Tagen ausgetragen werden muss (unabhängig von der Hallengröße). Bei einem 33er Raster wird dem normalen Gruppenraster noch eine Qualirunde vorgeschoben. Das heißt: Die sechs Qualifikanten haben, falls sie nicht in den Gruppen ausscheiden, sieben Einzel zu bewältigen. Dem gegenüber hätten einige andere Teilmehmer nur fünf Einzel.</p><p>Am Samstag um 9:30 Uhr fanden sich dann 27 Herren und 3 Damen zur Auslosung ein. Als die ersten Spiele absolviert waren, wurde dann der Wunsch der Spieler, das Turnier am Samstag fertig zu spielen, an die Turnierleitung herangetragen. Nach kurzem Durchfragen bei den Teilnehmern entschieden wir dann, dem Wunsch zu entsprechen, da es das Reglement auch zulässt. Schließlich geht es bei einem Turnier um die Spieler.</p><p>Alle Teilnehmer bemühten sich vor allem die Zeiten zwischen den Partien kurz zu halten und so ging es trotz einiger 3-Satzspiele schnell voran. Wesentlich früher als erwartet fanden dann die Semifinali zwischen Rene Krimbacher und Philipp Dalla-Rosa und zwischen Wolfgang Zeiml und Jürgen  Schwarzlmüller statt. Lukas Mizelli hätte hier sicher auch ein Wörtchen mitgesprochen, aber er musste das Turnier schon nach der Vorrunde wegen einem dringenden Termin verlassen. Standesgemäß mussten in beiden Semifinali die dritten Sätze entscheiden. Rene (27:25 im dritten Satz gegen Philipp) und Wolfgang erreichten somit das Finale. In dem setzte sich dann Rene Krimbacher in – wie sollte es sonst sein – drei Sätzen als Sieger durch.</p><p>Bei den Damen war das Teilnehmerfeld nicht besonders groß. Aber immerhin kam wieder ein Bewerb zustande. Christine Rebhandl konnte ihren<br>Heimvorteil nutzen und siegte ohne Satzverlust vor Sarah Anleitner und Simone Staufer.</p><p>Im Mixed wurde nur ein Spiel ausgetragen. Das gewannen Sarah Anleitner und Jürgen Schwarzlmüller gegen Christine und Fred Rebhandl. Natürlich<br>in drei Sätzen.</p><p>Zum Abschluß wurde auch noch Herrendoppel gespielt. Auch hier fanden wieder einige 3-Satzspiele statt. Allerdings ausnahmsweise gerade nicht<br>im Finale, das Jürgen Schmidt und Wolfgang Zeiml gegen Matthias Reischauer und Jürgen Schwarzlmüller gewinnen konnten.</p><p>Kurz nach 20:00 Uhr war das Turnier dann nach 75 absolvierten Spielen in 10 Stunden Spielzeit beendet.</p><p>Auch wenn ich für die Teilnehmer für nächstes Jahr auf größere Hallen hoffe, werden wir sicher auch gerne wieder ein Turnier ausrichten, wenn sich sonst niemand findet. Uns hat das Turnier mit euch auf jeden Fall viel Spaß gemacht!</p><p>[Bericht: Michael Kaun – Union Windischgarsten]</p>","2016-09-27","/content/news/1-C-Turnier-Region-Nord/5ba14dee24cbb.png","9");

Das Trainingszentrum der Provinzmannschaft befindet sich in der Millionenstadt Jinan (ca. 8 Mio. Einwohner). Hier trainieren im Sportinstitut für kleine Bälle die Sportarten Tennis, Tischtennis und Badminton.</p><p>Aufgrund einer Kooperation mit dem oberösterreichischen Tischtennis Verband <strong>(Kooperation Oberösterreich – Shandong)</strong> haben unsere jungen SportlerInnen die einmalige Möglichkeit das Jugendtraining der weltbesten Badmintonnation mitzuerleben. In Jinan trainieren hier die Nachwuchstalente im Alter von 6-18 Jahren. Nur die besten davon schaffen es vielleicht ins Nationalteam und der Konkurrenzkampf ist demensprechend hoch. In zahlreichen Trainingswettkämpfen wird von den chinesischen Jugendlichen um den Verbleib in der Mannschaft oder darum gespielt, wer zu nationalen und internationalen Turnieren fahren darf.</p><p>Luca, Laura , Kathi und Lena werden für uns in Form eines Tagebuchs von ihren Erlebnissen hier in China berichten. Den Anfang macht der 15-jährige <strong>Luca Froschauer vom ASKÖ Traun</strong>. Er berichtet uns über die Anreise und die ersten beiden Trainingstage:</p><p><em>„Der erste Flug von Linz nach Frankfurt verlief relativ normal und schnell. Die Wartezeit verging dank der doch sehr großen Aufregung sehr schnell. Der 9 Stunden Flug nach Peking war sehr ruhig und angenehm. Nach einer Busfahrt zum Bahnhof und einer 2 stündigen Zugfahrt sind wir endlich in Jinan angekommen. Voller Aufregung sind wir am nächsten Tag in das erste Training gestartet. Nach dem Aufwärmen begannen wir auch schon mit dem Einspielen und der ersten Übung. Aufgrund der schwülen Hitze in der Halle und der Nervosität haute es mir gleich zu Beginn den Kreislauf zusammen. Nach kurzer Pause ging es zum Glück wieder. Danach folgten noch ein paar Übungen und 40 Minuten Techniktraining. Danach gab es Essen. Nach 3 Stunden Pause begann auch schon das nächste Training. Nach dem Aufwärmen und dem Einspielen fingen wir mit der ersten Übung an. Nach 50 Minuten Übung hatten wir eine Pause. Danach folgten 30 Minuten Beinarbeit und 20 Minuten Sprints. Dann war auch das zweite Training vorbei. Das Training dauert hier immer 2,5 – 3h Stunden 2 Mal am Tag. Die Übungen sind nicht zu kompliziert, werden aber sehr lange und hart gemacht. (mind. 30-40 min. pro Übung) Danach gab es das Abendessen und später gingen wir schlafen.“<br></em></p><p>[Bericht: Lukas Rebhandl – Redaktion]</p>","2016-09-06","/content/news/Bericht-vom-OOEBV-Trainingslager-in-China/5ba14e3937c0c.png","8");

Der Auftakt erfolgte in Laakirchen im OÖ-Derby gegen Union Ohlsdorf und brachte ein gerechte Remis. Leider mussten die Alkovener auf den verletzten Stammspieler Thomas Hahn verzichten, wodurch Teammanager Fritz Freimüller zu einer neuen Aufstellungsvariante gezwungen war.  Das Match verlief bis zum letzten Punkt auf des Messers Schneide, 5 der 8 Spiele wurden erst im 3.Satz entschieden. Nach den Herrendoppel stand es 1:1. Während das Duo Lukas Rebhandl / Christoph Lessl ihr Doppel verlor, setzte sich Simon Rebhandl mit dem Teamneuling Richard Wan knapp durch. Das Damendoppel Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann brachte Alkoven dann mit 2:1 in Führung. Der zweite Teamneuling Peter Wetz und Routinier  Christoph Lessl hatten in ihren Einzelspielen keine Chance und damit wechselte die Führung wieder zugunsten von Ohlsdorf. Im Spitzenspiel des Tages steigerte sich Alkovens Nr.1 Lukas Rebhandl nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten und siegte verdient im 3.Satz. Sensationell verlief das Dameneinzel. Maria Steinmann lieferte der  viel höher eingeschätzten Katharina Hochmeir einen heißen Kampf, ehe sie sich doch mit 21:19, 20:22 und 18:21 geschlagen geben musste. Damit lag es wieder einmal beim gemischten Doppel Iris Freimüller/ Simon Rebhandl die Kastanien aus dem Feuer zu holen. Nach einem spannenden Match setzte sich das schon lange erfolgreiche Duo durch und holte damit den entscheidenden Punkt zum 4:4 Unentschieden. </em><br><strong><br> UBC Vorchdorf</strong><br><em>Es will einfach nicht sein! Wie in den letzten Jahren startete UBC Vorchdorf mit einer knappen Niederlage in Vorarlberg in die neue Saison. Nach hartem Kampf verlor das UBC Team gegen Feldkirch erneut mit 3 : 5.<br> Und die neue Saison begann ohne Überraschung. Rasch lag das Team aus Vorchdorf nach den Herrendoppel mit 0 : 2 im Rückstand. Das UBC-Damen Duo Miriam Gruber / Zita Banhegyi startete ebenfalls schlecht – konnte sich aber noch mit einem Dreisatzsieg zum ersten Punkt retten.<br> Während Primoz Flis und Erik Seiwald ihre Einzel knapp verloren, zeigte Miriam Gruber einmal mehr ihre Klasse. Sie siegte klar in zwei Sätzen und brachte Vorchdorf nochmals ins Spiel. Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi gelang nach mühevollem Start noch die Wende zum Dreisatzsieg. Florian Brandstötter zeigte lange Zeit gegen den Slowenen Turk ein gutes Spiel – letztlich scheiterte er im dritten Satz mit 22:24.<br> „Wir hätten uns auf jeden Fall einen Punkt verdient,“ zeigte sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl enttäuscht. „Die Chance im Ländle zu punkten, war selten so groß.“ </em></p><p><a href=\"https://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=7AAA19D0-0E65-42BF-8E03-6F1F6AE31C9A&draw=2\"><em><strong>Hier gehts zu den Ergebnissen auf Tournamentsoftware</strong></em></a></p><p>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</p>","2016-10-17","/content/news/Ergebnisse-2-Bundesliga-ndash-1-Spieltag/5ba14fc0866e4.png","9");

Badminton Bundesligasaison. Zum Auftakt gastieren die Vorchdorfer beim Vizemeister in Feldkirch. Bereits in die 24. Saison startet das Vorchdorfer Badmintonteam. „Das ist eigentlich schon ein Erfolg,“ ist UBC Obmann stolz, das Badminton in Vorchdorf keine Eintagsfliege ist. Bewährt hat sich auch die Mischung von heimischen Spielern gepaart mit Leistungsträgern, die über Jahre in Vorchdorf das Racket schwingen. „Die Mannschaft ist gegenüber der Vorsaison unverändert – wir setzen auf Kontinuität und Erfahrung,“ so Starl, der seit Beginn der Bundesliga Zugehörigkeit das Team betreut. Zum Auftakt müssen Kronsteiner & Co. ins Ländle, wo gegen Vizemeister BC Feldkirch eine schwierige Aufgabe wartet. Zuletzt verlor das UBC-Team immer knapp – und auch diesmal sind die Vorarlberger Favorit. „Ein Unentschieden wäre schon ein Erfolg.“<br></em></p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf</strong><br><em>Die Vorbereitungen zur neuen Saison verliefen aus unserer Sicht sehr gut. Die Spieler sind gut in Form, wie auch die Ergebnisse der erstenTurnierrunde zeigen. Unsere Mannschaft ist unverändert und eigentlich wollen wir heuer nichts mit dem Abstiegskampf zu tun haben, es gibt aber immer ein aber… Kärnten und Feldkirch sind für uns die Aufstiegskandidaten, wobei der Abstand nicht allzu groß sein wird. Eine spannende Saison ist auf jeden Fall garantiert. Das Spiel gegen Alkoven war in den letzten Jahren immer eine knappe Sache und wird für uns richtungsweisend sein. Mit dem Puplikum im Rücken hoffen wir aber auf einen Erfolg.<br></em></p><p><strong><br> BC Raiffeisen Alkoven</strong><br><em>Der  BC Raiffeisen Alkoven geht heuer in seine zehnte Saison in der 2.Bundesliga. Die Vorbereitungen für die Jubiläumssaison verliefen gut, die Mannschaft freut sich auf die bevorstehenden Aufgaben. Nach dem Abgang von Harald Hochgatterer wurde der Kader mit den Leihspielern Peter Wetz, Markus Hinz, Philipp Höhn und Johannes Schöll vergrößert. Die Liga dürfte heuer sehr  ausgeglichen sein, sodass mit jedem Ausgang zu rechnen ist. Wahrscheinlich sind ASKÖ Kelag Kärnten und Union Feldkirch Favoriten für die Plätze im Mittleren Play-off. Der Start erfolgt für uns in Ohlsdorf mit dem OÖ-Derby. Bereits im Vorjahr gab es ganz enge Partien. Mit Kampfgeist und etwas Glück hoffen wir zumindest einen Punkt entführen zu können.</em></p><p><strong>Askö Traun</strong><br><em>Die Trainingsqualität war durch  die Verpflichtung  des Rumänischen  Nachwuchstalentes Filimon Collins Valentine und der neuen Motivation „ 1. Bundesliga“ sehr hoch. Gemeinsam mit unserem Nachwuchs wurden die Trainingseinheiten mit hohem Einsatz und hoher Qualität absolviert. Unsere Borg SportlerInnen waren sogar 3 Wochen auf Trainingslager in China.  Die Mannschaft ist gut vorbereitet. Unser Team  ist heuer in einigen Positionen verändert. Bei den Damen sind wir durch die Neuzugänge Hidayat Uzchi Ananda aus Indonesien und Lais Janine  aus Vorarlberg  gut aufgestellt. Gemeinsam mit unseren  Girls  Laura Hauser, Lena Zinganell und Barbara Scheer verfügen wir über ein starke  Damenriege. Bei den Herren setzen wir neben den Rumänen  auf unsere Routiniers Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner. Alexander Serov, er hat im Sommer sehr gut trainiert,  Markus Ratzenböck  und Jakob Ostermann ergänzen das Team sehr gut. Wo wir genau stehen wissen wir als Liganeuling noch nicht. Wir müssen erst unsere Gegner kennenlernen. Wenn es optimal läuft kann am Ende  ein Semifinalplatz das Ziel sein. In der 1. Runde ist gleich der  regierenden Meister Wolfurt auswärts eine schwierige Hürde. Da  sind wir natürlich klare Außenseiter. Wir werden uns aber so teuer als möglich verkaufen.<br></em></p><p><strong>BSC 70 Linz</strong><br><em>„Wir haben eine sehr ausgeglichene, international erfahrene Mannschaft – Ziel ist es auch heuer wieder in das Meister-Play-off der Besten 4 Teams einzuziehen. Es wird sehr schwer in Mödling und sicher auch in der gesamten Saison.<br> Mit einem Unentschieden wären wir bei dieser schweren Aufgabe, zur 1.

Platz 2 erreichte Jonas Nußdorfer vom USC Attergau Badminton und Jonas Windauer gewann das Vereinsduell um dem 3. Rang gegen Maximilian Braun (beide Österreichische Turn- und Sportunion Ohlsdorf).<br>Im letzten Bewerb, dem JE U19, entschied Luca Froschauer [1] (ASKÖ Traun) das erste oberösterreichische Ranglistenturnier 2016/17 für sich. Die Plätze 2 und 3 erreichten Jan-Matteo Brüggenwerth und Carle Brüggenwerth (beide ASKÖ Badminton Linz).</p><p><a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/tournament.aspx?id=E9E96250-8711-4842-9AFE-E80AFF4B8718\"><em><strong>Hier gehts zu den Ergebnissen auf Tournamentsoftware</strong></em></a></p><p>Nennenswert ist, dass fast alle Anwesenden die Finalspiele ansahen und bis zur Siegerehrung vor Ort geblieben sind. So konnte um circa 17:00 Uhr die Siegerehrung abgehalten werden, wo die SportlerInnen mit Pokalen, Medaillen und Urkunden belohnt wurden.<br>Herzlichen Dank an alle TeilnehmerInnen und BetreuerInnen, die den Weg nach Windischgarsten antraten und so einen tollen Turniertag ermöglichten. Wir freuen uns auf das nächste Turnier, dann hoffentlich mit genügend Teilnehmerinnen im U19 Mädcheneinzel.</p><p>[Bericht: BC Windischgarsten]</p>","2016-10-11","/content/news/1-OOEBV-U15JGD-RLT-201617/5ba1501502626.png","5");

Obwohl wir von den vorherigen Wochen erschöpft waren, versuchten wir in den Trainings immer unser Bestes zu geben und von den tollen Einheiten zu profitieren. Schlussendlich brach der finale Tag an, und wir begaben uns – wie üblich – um 8:15 in die Halle, wo uns der Trainer und die SpielerInnen erwarteten, von denen wir uns bald schweren Herzens verabschieden würden müssen. Um 17:25 war es vorbei. Der letzte 400-Meter-Sprint. Das letzte Mal röchelnd nach der Trinkflasche greifen. All dies lag nun hinter uns, und wir wussten, dass nun die Heimreise bevorstand. Der Abend wurde dann mit den chinesischen SpielerInnen, die uns sehr ans Herz gewachsen sind, verbracht und war ein netter Ausklang unserer Reise. Nachdem die Sonne in Jinan schon lang untergegangen war, traten wir unsere rund 26 Stunden dauernde Reise an. Zuerst wurden wir mit dem Bus zum lokalen Bahnhof kutschiert, an dem uns der Zug nach Peking erwartete. Von dort fuhren wir – nach kurzem Beine vertreten – mit dem Bus zu unserem letzten Halt in China, dem Flughafen. Hoch über den Wolken segelnd, schon von österreichischen Schnitzeln träumend, die nun zum Greifen nah schienen, wurden wir sanft und ohne Turbulenzen zum Wiener Flughafen befördert. Nun war es bald soweit, ein letztes Mal Koffer schleppen und ein letztes Mal von A nach B fahren. Nicht lange dauerte es, bis wir endlich am Linzer Bahnhof ankamen, wo wir – mehr oder weniger peinlich – von unseren Familien begrüßt wurden. Wir hatten es geschafft! Das Trainingslager in China war richtig motivierend, besonders begeistert waren wir vom fordernden Training, der Gastfreundlichkeit und dem Essen!</em>“</p><p>Lena Zinganell, L-BORG Linz<br>Laura Hauser, L-BORG Linz</p>","2016-10-04","/content/news/Trainingstagebuch-aus-Jinan-CHN-ndash-Abschlussbericht/5ba150595f01d.png","5");

Wolfgang Gnedt fühl sich in Linz zuhause und auch die Chemie zwischen Vereinsführung, Bundesligateam und Familie Gnedt passt zu 100%. Beide Seiten wissen was sie aneinander haben. In diesem ruhigen und freundschaftlichen Umfeld kann Wolfgang auch seine TOP-Leistungen abrufen. Zuletzt war in der 1. Bundesliga im 1. Einzel 2mal erfolgreich und musste sich nur Luka Wraber ganz knapp in 3 Sätzen beugen.</p><p>Nichts für schwache Nerven wird auch das Aufeinandertreffen im 2.

Die Vorentscheidung brachte der knappe Sieg von Jürgen Koch im ersten Herren- Einzel. Im Sonntagspiel konnten wir den Umstand, dass Mödling krankheitsbedingt 2 Spiele w.o. gab, nicht wirklich nutzen, sodass wir letztlich mit dem Unentschieden zufrieden sein mussten. Leider waren die Ergebnisse bei den anderen Begegnungen alles andere als gut für uns.

Beide besiegten ihre Gegner in den Einzelspielen durch nervenstarkes Spiel knapp im 3.Satz. Auch im Doppel konnten die beiden mit einem unerwarteten Sieg überzeugen. Schwerer als erwartet taten sich die Brüder Simon und Lukas Rebhandl in ihrem Doppel, letztendlich setzten sie sich aber im 3.Satz deutlich durch. Den sechsten Punkt steuerte das Mixed Maria Steinmann/Simon Rebhandl bei.<br> Der Sieg hätte auch noch höher ausfallen können, aber das Damendoppel Iris Freimüller/Maria Steinmann verlor genauso knapp wie Lukas Rebhandl in seinem Einzel.<br> Mit dem Erfolg gegen Podersdorf liegt der BC Raiffeisen Alkoven jetzt an 4.Stelle der Tabelle und damit lebt die Chance auf den Klassenerhalt wieder.</em><br><strong>-BC Raiffeisen Alkoven-</strong></p><p><em>Wenige Erfolgserlebnisse für UBC Vorchdorf beim Start ins neue Jahr.

Badminton Bundesliga aus und wird ab der kommenden Saison in der 2. Bundesliga antreten. Sonja Langthaler und Wolfgang Gnedt weiterhin BSC 70 Linz Stammspieler – der Verein wird ihre Entwicklung weiterhin stark unterstützen.</strong></p><p>Liebe Sportfreunde, liebe Pressevertreter,</p><p>der Askö BSC 70 Linz scheidet nach 40 Jahren ununterbrochener Bundesligazugehörigkeit zur 1. Bundesliga/Staatsliga (1972-1977 Staatsliga B; seit 1977 in Staatsliga A/1. Bundesliga) mit Ende der Saison 2016/2017 freiwillig aus der 1. Bundesliga aus. Bisher spielt man 45 Jahre in der Badminton Bundesliga.</p><p><strong>Knalleffekt zum Ausstieg aus der 1. Badminton Bundesliga</strong><br>In einer vor den Play-off Spielen der Badminton Bundesliga stattgefundenen Vorstandssitzung des BSC 70 Linz hat die Vereinsführung mit sofortiger Wirkung sämtliche Verträge mit den Spielern aufgelöst. Das Bundesligateam steigt damit freiwillig und erstmals in der Vereinsgeschichte aus der 1. Badminton Bundesliga aus. Die Vereinsführung zieht damit einerseits die Konsequenz aus der verpassten Chance auf den Staatsmeistertitel 2016/2017 und wird einen Neustart, mit neuer Ausrichtung, in der 2. Bundesliga vornehmen.</p><p><strong>BSC 70 Linz als Basis zur Weiterentwicklung für Sonja Langthaler und Wolfgang Gnedt im Spitzensport</strong><br>Mit den österreichischen Leistungsträgern Sonja Langthaler und Wolfgang Gnedt wird die Vereinsführung die Zusammenarbeit verlängern. Ohne einem Team in der 1. Bundesliga wird die Basis für die beiden jedoch im Teambewerb nicht im Heimverein liegen (können). Selbstverständlich wird der BSC 70 Linz den beiden Sportlern die Möglichkeit und Unterstützung bei Ihrer sportlichen Entwicklung weiter geben. Beide konnten bei den Staatsmeisterschaften 2017  Medaillen (Sonja Gold im Mixed Doppel, Wolfgang Bronze im Herren Einzel) holen.</p><p><strong>Gründe für den Ausstieg:</strong><br>Zum einen die Finanzierbarkeit des Spitzensports (Beginnend bei den Subventionen und Rahmenbedingungen für den Sport), zum anderen wollen wir nach mehreren Jahrzehnten, wo wir Österreichs Badminton mitgestaltet und offensive Arbeit dafür geleistet haben, eine Neuausrichtung der sportlichen Ziele und der Vereinsarbeit durch den Vorstand und all seinen Freiwilligen.</p><p><strong>Wie ist der Ausstieg des BSC 70 Linz möglich….</strong><br>Der Verein hat im Zuge der der verpassten Chance auf den Staatsmeistertitel nunmehr folgende Möglichkeiten:</p><p>Das Bundesligateam wird nach der Play-off Phase der aktuellen Saison aufgelöst, und das 2. Team BSC 70 Linz, welches am letzten Freitag seinem 15. OÖ. Landesmeistertitel geholt hatte, geht ins Aufstiegs Play-off und qualifiziert sich für die 2. Bundesliga. </p><p>Das Bundesligateam steigt im Zuge des Play-offs aus der 1. Bundesliga in die 2. Bundesliga ab, und muss sich somit nicht für die 2. Bundesliga (mit der 2. Mannschaft aus der OÖ. Landesliga) qualifizieren. Diese Mannschaft kann damit auch in der 1. OÖ. Landesliga weiterhin antreten.</p><p><strong>Zukünftige sportliche Ausrichtung des BSC 70 Linz in der 2. Badminton Bundesliga</strong><br>Von Seiten des Vereinsvorstandes wird das Konzept für das Juniorteams für die Bundesliga wieder schlagend. Der BSC 70 Linz hatte während der letzten Jahre auch über mehrere Saisonen ein „Junior Team“ in der 2. Bundesliga am Start. Leider konnte dieses Projekt nicht auf Dauer finanziert werden.<br>In der 2. Bundesliga wird der BSC 70 Linz vermehrt auf die Teilnahme von Linzer SportlerInnen setzen und den regionalen Badmintonsport fördern.<br>Hier gilt es wieder, auf längere Frist, eine gute Perspektive für ambitionierte Sportler geben zu können. Der Askö BSC 70 Linz will und wird auch im Linzer Raum die Plattform für den Sprung in die Bundesliga sein und hier mit den Linzer Vereinen und Schulen kooperieren. Einige Gespräche mit den Vereins- und Schulverantwortlichen hat es bereits gegeben, weitere werden in den nächsten Wochen/Monaten folgen. Dieser Umbau in der sportlichen Ausrichtung wird sicherlich einen längeren Zeitraum in Anspruch nehmen.</p><p><strong>Kommentar des Obmanns Reinhard Hechenberger</strong><br>„<em>Eine solche Entscheidung zu treffen ist nicht einfach, schließlich spielt der Verein bereits 45 Jahre in der Badminton Bundesliga; 40 Jahre davon ununterbrochen in der 1. Bundesliga. Der Vereinsvorstand hat alle Für und Wider und die mit dieser Entscheidung zusammenhängenden Folgen versucht bis ins Details zu analysieren. Unterm Strich steht und fällt alles mit der Finanzierbarkeit und mit dem Idealismus von einigen Sportverrückten. Die Rahmenbedingungen für die 1. Bundesliga sind vorerst einmal nicht mehr gegeben. Wir werden in der 2. Bundesliga einen Neuanfang und eine Neuausrichtung wagen. Dennoch wollen wir Spitzensport weiter fördern und Sonja Langthaler sowie Wolfgang Gnedt weiterhin die Basis dafür ermöglichen.</em>“</p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-03-26","/content/news/Askoe-BSC-70-Linz-steigt-in-die-2-Bundesliga-ab/5ba2911ea850b.png","9");

Dem 12-maligen! Staatsmeister würde nach einer langen Durststrecke von 6 Jahren (letzte Finalteilnahme und gleichzeitig Titel 2011) der Titel sehr viel bedeuten. Leicht wird es aber auf keinen Fall. Die beiden Duelle im Grunddurchgang verliefen nicht nach Trauner Wunsch. Das erste Spiel verlor man Zuhause mit 1:7; Auswärts gab es ein 4:4. Besonders das 4:4 Unentschieden lässt Traun hoffen. Bei bester Besetzung und einer taktisch guten Aufstellung könnte der Sieger des Grunddurchgangs sicher gefordert bzw. besiegt werden. </p><p><strong>Einschätzung des Managers Herbert Koch</strong><br>„<em>Als Aufsteiger sind wir gegen die Sieger des Grunddurchganges sicher nicht die Favoriten. Wenn wir allerdings  in den Vorrundenspielen komplett angetreten sind, haben wir bei den 5 Matches  4x gewonnen und  1x, eben gegen Mödling, unentschieden gespielt. Wie es derzeit aussieht werden wir am 25.3. beim Heimspiel  und am 1.4. beim Rückspiel wieder mit der Indonesierin Uzchi Ananda Hydajat, in stärkster  Besetzung präsent sein. Die Leistungsträger Jürgen Koch und Peter Zauner sind für das Match ebenso gut vorbereitet.<br> Mit dem  Heimvorteil in der eigenen Halle und mit  der kräftigen Unterstützung  durch das Publikum könnte der Vorteil zu unseren Gunsten ausschlagen. Jedenfalls wird es nach 2011 wieder ein Badminton- Ereignis der Sonderklasse. Wir freuen uns auf die Partie und versprechen den 100-prozentigen Einsatz der ges.

Zur Verabschiedung des erfolgreichsten Trainers in der Ära des oberösterreichischen Badmintonverbandes möchte <em>badminton-ooe.at</em> in einer 3-teiligen Bericht-Serie über die Spieler- und Trainerlaufbahn von Yan Yujiang berichten. </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Die offizielle Verabschiedung von Yan Yujiang wird beim 1. Bundesliga Semifinale am 25. März in Traun ab 16:00 Uhr stattfinden!</strong></p><p><strong>Teil 1 von 3</strong></p><p><strong>Wie findet ein chinesischer Spitzentrainer den Weg nach Österreich?<br> Glücklicher Zufall bestimmte die rasante Entwicklung des österreichischen Badmintonsports!</strong></p><p>Yan Yujiang war als chinesischer Jugendnationaltrainer gerade auf Europa-Tournee mit dem chinesischen Jugendnationalteam. Nach internationalen Jugendturnieren in Russland und Bulgarien war im Frühjahr 1989 die letzte Turnier-Station in Polen, wo auch der österreichische Jugendwart Heinz Klimetschek und der österreichische Jugendspieler Hannes Fuchs teilnahmen. Heinz Klimetschek nutzte die Chance und lud Yan, dessen hohe Fachkompetenz ihm sofort auffiel, zu einem Trainingslager nach Österreich ein.<br>Nach einer kurzen Bedenkzeit und dem Abklären mit dem Chinesischen Verband sagte Yan zu, bei diesem Trainingslager als Coach dabei zu sein. Im August 1990 kam es schließlich zum ersten Besuch in Österreich und zu einer weiteren wichtigen Begegnung. Bei dem 3-wöchigen Trainingslager in Österreich (Weiz und Wien) bei dem Spieler wie u.a. Jürgen Koch, Hannes Fuchs, Harald Koch, Heimo Götschl, Heinz Fischer, Sabine Ploner,…) teilnahmen, lernte Yan das damalige Mitglied des österreichischen Jugendausschusses und jetzigen OÖBV-Präsidenten Herbert Koch kennen. Dieser holte gerade seine Söhne Jürgen und Harald vom Nationalkaderkurs in Wien ab und beschloss den chinesischen Fachmann auch nach Oberösterreich einzuladen.<br>Geplant war ein kurzes Trainingslager mit dem OÖBV-Kader, doch Yan fühlte sich sofort wohl in Österreich und beschloss für längere Zeit hier leben zu wollen. Maßgeblichen Anteil an der Verpflichtung von Yan Yujiang hatte der damalige ÖBV-Nachwuchsverantwortliche Heinz Klimetschek. Somit war der Beginn einer der erfolgreichsten Abschnitte im österreichischen Badmintonsport besiegelt.<br>Yan lebte im oberösterreichischen Traun und war für den Oberösterreichischen Badmintonverband als Trainer tätig. In den Anfängen teilweise auch im Hause Koch untergebracht war es eine Zeit mit viel Improvisation. Im November 1991 kamen auch Gattin Sun Pei und die damals 10-jährige Tochter Yan Yan nach Österreich. Im Laufe der nächsten Jahre wurde durch den Einfluss von Yan das gesamte Umfeld des oberösterreichischen Badmintonsports und österreichischen Badmintonsports professioneller. In zahlreichen Gesprächen und Sitzungen wurde gemeinsam mit den maßgeblichen Funktionären eine Struktur entwickelt, die den Österreichischen Badmintsport nahe an die Europäische Spitze gebracht hat.<br>Die Familie Yan lebte sich immer mehr in Österreich ein und auch die ersten Erfolge der Sportler ließen nicht mehr lange auf sich warten. Es war eine Zeit in der es 2 Stützpunkte in Linz und Wien gab, die beide unter der Leitung von Yan Yujiang geführt wurden. Die Spieler pendelten häufig hin und her, um auch von den Trainings profitieren zu können. </p><p>Wir haben einige seiner langjährigen Weggefährten und erfolgreichsten SportlerInnen Fragen über Yan Yujiang befragt. Den Anfang machen OÖBV-Präsident Herbert Koch, Hannes Fuchs und Jürgen Koch.</p><p><strong>Herbert Koch, Mit-Entdecker und langjähriger Freund </strong></p><p><strong>Was hat die Verpflichtung von Yan als Trainer für den Badmintonsport in Oberösterreich und Österreich gebracht?</strong><br><em>Durch die Verpflichtung von Yan Yujiang hat für den österreichischen Badmintonsport eine neue Zeitrechnung begonnen. Wir wurden ab diesem Zeitpunkt mit Weltklassebadminton konfrontiert. Nach beidseitigen Anfangssproblemen (Sprache, Mentalität zum Spitzensport, usw.) wurde aus der Verpflichtung des ehemaligen chinesischen Weltklasseathleten eine Erfolgsgeschichte. Viele Nationen beneideten uns um die Verpflichtung des chinesischen Top-Trainers. Aufgrund seiner guten Kontakte nach China kamen auch viele chinesische Top-Spieler wie Weltmeister Zhao Jianhua, Olympia-Silbermedaillengewinner Dong Jiong nach Oberösterreich. Diese Spieler trainierten in China noch unter der Handschrift von Yan Yujiang.<br></em><br><strong>Hannes Fuchs, ehemalige Nr. 14 der Welt im Herreneinzel und 2-facher Olympiateilnehmer</strong></p><p><strong>Yan ist 1990 nach Österreich gekommen. Was glaubst du hat das Training von Yan in Österreich geändert?</strong><br><em>Yan hat neue Trainingsmethoden eingeführt, einige Übungen eingebracht die vorher weitgehend unbekannt in Österreich waren. Damit hat er uns Spieler, aber natürlich auch andere Trainer, inspiriert.</em><br><strong><br> Was hast du als Spieler von ihm gelernt?</strong><br><em>Yan hat mich dazu gebracht noch mehr an die eigenen Grenzen zu gehen. Da die Physis im Badminton enorm wichtig ist um Weltklasse zu werden und vorallem auch das Niveau halten zu können. Yan hat mir aber auch technisch viele Feinheiten beigebracht und mir den nötigen Feinschliff verpasst.</em></p><p><strong>Wie hat Yan das Training aufgebaut und systematisiert?</strong><br><em>Yan hat rund um seine Standardübungen Varianten eingebaut. Gewisse Standardübungen waren immer dabei, Kraft und Ausdauertraining abseits des Courts habe ich immer selbst gecheckt. Yan hat mit mir „nur „ badmintonspezifisch am Court gearbeitet. Ich bin Yan sehr dankbar weil ich mich durch ihn weiterentwickelt habe und er auch wesentlichen Anteil an meinen Erfolgen hatte.</em></p><p><strong>Jürgen Koch, Jugend-Europameister im Herreneinzel und Olympiateilnehmer</strong></p><p><strong>Wie lange hast du unter Yan als Trainer trainiert?</strong><br><em>Yan ist im Sommer 1990 für einige Trainingskurse nach Österreich gekommen und dann anschließend bei uns geblieben. Ich war zu dieser Zeit 17 Jahre alt. Ich habe dann fast 20 Jahre täglich mit Yan trainiert und in den letzten Jahren gelegentlich.<br></em><br><strong>Was waren deine größten Erfolge als Spieler? </strong><br><em>1991 würde ich Jugendeuropameister im Einzel. Kurz vor der EM erkrankte ich an Masern und wir hatten nur 1 bis 2 Wochen für die Vorbereitung zur Verfügung. Yan hat mich aber trotz der kurzen Zeit wieder körperlich fit und mental bereit gebracht.<br> Beste Weltranglistenplatzierungen: HE: 23./HD:21./MIX:5.<br> 3. Platz German Open 2003 im HE</em></p><p><strong>Was hast du technisch und taktisch von Yan gelernt?</strong><br><em>Die besten Weltranglistenplatzierungen in allen 3 Disziplinen zeigen glaube ich, dass mich Yan zu einem technisch und taktisch gut ausgebildeten Spieler gemacht hat. Dafür bin ich natürlich Yan sehr dankbar. Ich habe in meiner sehr langen Kariere auch sehr viele internationale Trainer im Ausland kennengelernt und war immer wieder froh einen so hochqualifizierten Trainer Zuhause zu haben. Yan war ja selbst als Spieler absolute Weltklasse und von dieser Erfahrung konnte ich natürlich auch sehr viel profitieren. </em></p><p><strong>Welchen Einfluss hatte Yan auf den österreichischen Badmintonsport? </strong><br><em>Yan war allgemein für die guten Leistungen zwischen 1991 bis schätze ich 2004 hauptverantwortlich. Man sieht jetzt noch immer welche Spieler und Trainer die Technik von Yan gelehrt bekommen haben.<br></em><br><strong><br> Fortsetzung folgt:<br> Im 2.

Badminton Bundesliga brachte spannende, knappe Spiele. Askö Traun schaffte den Einzug in die Play-Offs während sich der BSC 70 Linz im Abstiegskampf beweisen muss. </strong></p><p>Der Spieltag in der Übersicht: Die bereits fix für das Play-Off qualifizierten Teams aus Wolfurt und Mödling trennten sich 3:5. Spannender die beiden Duelle der Teams aus Oberösterreich. Traun genügte ein 4:4 Unentschieden im Heimspiel gegen Tabellenschlusslicht Pressbaum. Und es wurde eine Punktlandung. Traun konnte die stärken im Herrendoppel ausspielen und gewann beide Doppel souverän. Die Pressbaumer kamen aber zurück, gewannen das Damendoppel und 1. Herreneinzel und stellten damit auf 2:2. Das zweite Herreneinzel ging an Traun, doch sowohl Dameneinzel als auch das dritte Herreneinzel gingen an Pressbaum. Somit war das Mixeddoppel Zauner/Lais gegen Seiwald/Meinke unter Zugzwang. Die Trauner konnten sich aber für die Niederlage bei den Staatsmeisterschaften revanchieren und gewannen denkbar knapp im 3. Satz 21:19. Traun steht damit in den Play-Offs und spielt gegen den Sieger des Grunddurchgangs Mödling. </p><p>Gleiche Vorzeichen auch beim Spiel Wien gegen Linz. Den Linzern reicht ein 4:4 Unentschieden. Die Wiener starteten aber Zuhause sehr stark und konnten gleich beide Herrendoppel für sich entscheiden. Das anschließende Damendoppel ging aber klar an Linz. Im ersten Herreneinzel musst sich Wolfgang Gnedt in 2 Sätzen gegen Luka Petric geschlagen geben. Danach verkürzte Miha Ivanic auf 2:3. Im Dameneinzel konnte sich Katarina Galenic gegen Ana Marija Setina durchsetzen und Wien damit mit 4:2 in Front bringen. Nun lag der Druck auf Miha Sepec der damit offensichtlich gut zurecht kam und Lukas Weißenbäck im dritten Herreneinzel besiegte. Das alles entscheidende Mixeddoppel ging aber im dritten Satz ganz klar mit 21:7 an Wien und somit verpasste der BSC 70 Linz hauchdünn das Play-Off.<br><strong><br> Resumée</strong><br>Die Bundesligasaison 2016/2017 verlief für die Teams aus Oberösterreich gut. Ziel der Teams aus OÖ war sicher das Erreichen der Play-Offs. Für Linz sah es lange Zeit sehr gut aus und die Play-Offs waren in Reichweite. Schlussendlich konnte aber im direkten Duell gegen die starken Wiener kein Unentschieden erzielt werden und somit nur der 5. Platz erreicht werden. Linz spielt daher um den Verbleib in der 1. Bundesliga gegen Pressbaum, Klagenfurt und Feldkirch. Besser verlief die Saison für Traun die sich mit etwas Glück im letzten Spiel ganz knapp den Play-Off Platz sicherten. Gegner im Play-Off wird Mödling sein.<br>Fakten zum Schluss: Laut Spielerstatistik ist Peter Zauner von Askö Traun der beste Spieler aus Oberösterreich (2. Platz hinter Luka Wraber). Er konnte 16 seiner 18 Spiele für sich entscheiden. </p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-03-07","/content/news/Letzte-Runde-1-Bundesliga/5ba292cf48658.png","5");

Spielen um den Meistertitel mit sehr viel Emotionen und Spannung verbunden. Die Atmosphäre und die Fans in der Halle machen eine Begegnung noch einmal schwerer. Leider konnten wir in den entscheidenden Spielen in Wien nicht sehr oft das besserer Ende für uns verbuchen. Es wird daher auch für unsere Spieler eine mental sehr schwierige Situation. In dieser Begegnung muss alles zusammenpassen, auch wenn uns für das Erreichen des Meister Play-off Platzes ein 4:4 reicht. Auf so ein Ergebnis zu spielen wäre aber fatal, daher heißt die Devise „voller Angriff“ und so agieren als würden wir einen Sieg benötigen. Unsere Spieler werden alles geben um unsere Teilnahme am Meister Play-off zu fixieren. Wir erwarten heiß umkämpfte Spiele und werden selbstverständlich auf unsere Stärken bauen. Diese liegen in dieser Saison vor allem in den Einzelspielen. Dort müssen wir unbedingt unsere Punkte holen. Diesmal wird auch wieder Wolfgang Gnedt mit an Board sein. (er fehlt in der letzten Runde krankheitsbedingt) In den Doppelspielen wird sich Teammanager Harald Hochgatterer für die besten Variante entscheiden.</p><p><strong>Kommentar Hechenberger:</strong><br>„<em>Es wird um den vierten Meister Play-off Platz noch einmal ganz heiß. Linz benötigt für die letzte Partie einen Punkt. Ein Unentschieden würde uns also reichen. Wien muss auf Sieg spielen um den Play-off Platz einfahren zu können.In Wien zu spielen ist aber immer ganz schwer. Zuletzt gingen Wolfurt und Mödling (derzeit erster und zweiter der Tabelle) in der Bundeshauptstadt unter. Wir wissen also, dass es für uns ein ganz, ganz schweres Spiel wird.In diesem entscheidenden Spiel wird es sich zeigen was in der Mannschaft steckt und wie sehr der Teamgeist ausgeprägt ist.Teammanager Harald Hochgatterer (Bild) wird in der letzten Runde des Grunddurchganges alles versuchen um die Mannschaft bestmöglich einzustellen und sie zu Höchstform pushen.</em>“</p><p><strong><br> Askö Traun (Herbert Koch)</strong><br>In der 10. und letzten Runde des Grunddurchganges ist unser Gegner die  letztplatzierte Mannschaft von ASV Pressbaum. Bereits mit einem Unentschieden ist ASKÖ Traun fix für die Entscheidungsspiele qualifiziert, egal wie das  Paralellspiel der beiden anderen Anwärter auf einen Halbfinalplatz,  WBH Wien und BSC 70 Linz, in der Bundeshauptstadt ausgeht. In unserer Begegnung gegen die Junge Niederösterreichische Mannschaft  ist noch einmal volle Konzentration und maximaler Einsatz erforderlich. Auch die Unterstützung unseres Publikums wir mit entscheiden sein. Um die Tabellenführung spielt in der Schlussrunde  UBC Wolfurt gegen ASKÖ Mödling. Die Halbfinal- Best- of -3 Serie beginnt dann  am 25.3.2017. Dabei  treffen der 1. Platzierte auf den 4. Platzierten und der 2.Platzierte auf den Dritten des Grunddurchganges aufeinander. ASKÖ Traun hat den letzten der 12 Staatsmeistertitel im Jahr 2011 gewonnen und möchte  im heurigen Jahr zumindest ein Wort bei der Entscheidung mitreden.</p><p><strong>Kommentar Koch:</strong><br>„<em>In den 5 Spielen bei denen wir komplett angetreten sind, haben wir 4 mal gewonnen und 1 mal unentschieden gespielt. Diese Tatsache stimmt uns für die letzte Runde zuversichtlich.

Allerdings wissen wir natürlich, dass die Vorarlberger den Vorteil der Heimhalle, und die Unterstützung des Publikums  auf ihrer Seite haben. Es ist auch zu erwarten dass uns eine andere Aufstellung des Gegners erwartet.<br> Als Aufsteiger haben wir das Saisonziel ja mit dem Finaleizug bereits überboten. Wenn man so knapp am Titel dran ist, will man natürlich am Ende ganz oben stehen, ist der Tenor der gesamten  Mannschaft.<br> Wir werden bereits am Freitag nach Vorarlberg anreisen und am Abend  noch ein Training absolvieren. In  dieser Woche haben sich alle Mannschaftsmitglieder in sehr guter Form präsentiert. Die Motivation des gesamten Teams, einschließlich der  Betreuer, ist schon lange nicht so groß gewesen.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Auch einige Schlachtenbummler werden die Reise ins Ländle mitmachen, sodass wir stimmungsmäßig nicht ganz untergehen werden. Vielleicht gelingt uns nach 2011 wieder der  Titelgewinn,  der 13. In der Vereinsgeschichte.</em>“<br><strong><br> [Bericht: Askö Traun]</strong></p>","2017-04-28","/content/news/Badminton-Bundesliga-Finale/5ba29488408cf.png","4");

Das Team um Serien-Staatsmeister Jürgen Koch ließ in der eigene Halle keine Satzgewinn der Gäste zu, die nach dem ersten, verlorenen Satz gegen Peter Zauner/Janine Lais das Spiel aufgaben. Zuvor hatte das Herrendoppel Jürgen Koch/Peter Zauner, Jürgen Koch im Herreneinzel, das Damendoppel Uzchi Ananda Hidayat/Janine Lais und Uzchi Ananda Hidayat im Dameneinzel die Trauner mit 4:0 in Führung gebracht. </strong></p><p>Der viel umjubelte Sieg der Trauner war doch etwas überraschend.

Dabei waren die Trauner aber noch ohne die stark spielende Legionärin Uzchi Ananda Hidayat angetreten. </p><p>Der erste Schritt in Richtung Meistertitel ist also getan. Die Trauner haben bereits eine Hand auf dem Pokal. Jetzt gilt es aber auch auswärts in einer ungewohnten Halle zu bestehen. Zu sicher sollte man sich aus Trauner Sicht nicht sein. Das Ergebnis von 5:0 klingt natürlich sehr klar, die Wolfurter sind aber gerade im 3. Herreneinzel und 2. Herrendoppel leicht zu favorisieren. Traun ist also gewarnt und wird sicherlich kein Spiel auf die leichte Schulter nehmen. </p><p>Weiter geht es am Samstag, 29. April 2017 um 15:00 in der Hofsteighalle in Wolfurt.

Auch wir waren aufgrund der Verletzung von Janine Lais (Hautablösung am Fußballen) leider gezwungen, die erfolgreiche Mannschaft aus dem Hinspiel zu verändern. Der Spielverlauf war auch gekennzeichnet, dass jeder Satz und jeder Spielpunkt hart umkämpft war. Bei einem Unentschieden geht die Mannschaft als Sieger hervor, die das bessere Satz- und wenn erforderlich, das bessere Punkteverhältnis aufweist. Die Unterstützung durch die gesamten Kadermitglieder und der mitgereisten Fans puschte die Mannschaft ständig nach vorne. Die wichtigen Anweisungen durch den Trainer Yan Yuijang trugen jedenfalls zum großartigen Erfolg bei.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Nach dem Wechselbad der Gefühle während des Spieles war die gesamte Mannschaft sehr glücklich. Der Einzug ins Finale gegen UBSC Wolfurt ist wieder ein Höhepunkt in der Vereinsgeschichte und der Lohn für eine gute Vorbereitung und eine starke Leistung in den entscheidenden Auseinandersetzungen. Der gesamte Kader freut sich auf die 1. Final-Begegnung mit dem Titelverteidiger aus Vorarlberg am 22. April in Traun. Natürlich werden wir versuchen das bereits deutlich überbotene Saisonziel noch zu toppen. Vielleicht als Aufsteiger aus der B-Liga gleich eine große Überraschung zu liefern und den bereits  13. Meistertitel nach 2011 zu schaffen, war man sich beim abschließenden, gemeinsamen Abendessen, einig.</em>7<br><strong><br> Mittleres Play-Off</strong></p><p>Im Mittleren Play-Off verlor der BSC 70 Linz sein Heimspiel gegen askö Kelag Kärnten mit 2:6. Damit stehen die Linzer bereits, ein Spiel vor Ende der Play-Offs als Absteiger fest. Gute Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 1.

Der OÖBV berichtet im zweiten Teil der Berichterstattung von badminton-ooe.at über die Erfolgsbilanz als Spieler und Trainer in China.</strong></p><p><strong>Chinesische Weltklasse-Athleten zu Gast in Oberösterreich</strong><br>Durch die guten Kontakte nach China kamen immer wieder hochkarätige Trainingspartner nach Österreich. Spieler wie Zhao Jianhua (Weltmeister) und Dong Jiong (ehem. Weltranglisten-Erster, Vize-Olympiasieger) besuchten ihren ehemaligen Trainer und gaben im Training wichtige Tipps für die österreichischen Spieler weiter. Immer wieder erfuhren österreichische SportlerInnen auf internationalen Turnieren von anderen chinesischen Trainern in Europa, welch Glücksfall es ist einen Trainer von diesem Format in Österreich zu haben.</p><p>Im Jahr 1990 beschloss der österreichische Badmintonverband schließlich Yan Yujiang als Nationaltrainer anzustellen. </p><p><strong>Große Erfolge als Spieler und Trainer in China</strong><br>Bevor Yan Yujiang nach Österreich kam war er in China als Cheftrainer der Herrenmannschaft in der chinesischen Jinagsu-Provinz tätig. Spieler wie Yang Yang, Zhao Jianhua – beide wurden später Weltmeister – trainierten unter seiner Handschrift. Weiters war er als Jugendnationaltrainer der Herren in China unter anderem für Dong Jiong (Olympiasilbermedaillengewinner 1996) zuständig, bevor er schließlich nach Österreich kam.</p><p>Seine Erfahrungen als chinesischer Weltklasse-Spieler waren eine große Hilfe dabei.</p><p><strong>Größte Erfolge als Spieler</strong><br>> Chinesischer Meister, 1977: Finale gegen Chen Tianlong: 15:12, 15:5 (späterer Weltmeister)<br>> Sieg Chinesische Nationalspiele, 1979: Finale gegen Han Jian: 15:11, 15:3 (mehrmaliger Weltmeister)</p><p>Man kann sagen, dass Yan Yujiang zu seiner besten Zeit zu einem der besten Spieler in China und auch der Welt zählte. Aufgrund einer schweren Verletzung im Jahre 1978 (Achillessehne wurde gerissen), war er gezwungen ein Jahr zu pausieren und konnte sich somit nicht für die Weltmeisterschaft im Mai 1979 qualifizieren. Doch vier Monate später konnte er bei den Chinesischen Nationalspielen den neugebackenen BWF Weltmeister Han Jian im Herreneinzel deutlich mit 15:11 und 15:3 bezwingen. Da die Berichterstattung in seiner aktiven Zeit als Spieler noch nicht mit der heutigen Medienlandschaft vergleichbar war, findet man kaum noch Aufzeichnungen seiner Erfolge. Auf Wikipedia sind über Yan Yujiang folgende Daten zu finden: </p><p>> <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Yujiang\"><em><strong>Spieler Info Yan Yujiang</strong></em></a><br>> <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_bei_den_Chinesischen_Nationalspielen\"><em><strong>Alle Titelträger der chinesischen Nationalspiele</strong></em></a><br>> <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinesische_Badmintonmeisterschaft\"><em><strong>Alle Titelträger der chinesischen Meisterschaften</strong></em></a></p><p>Zu seiner besten Zeit als Spieler war China bei den offiziellen Badminton Weltmeisterschaften ausgeschlossen. Yan beendete im Alter von 28 Jahren seine Karriere als Profisportler. Damals war das ein normaler Vorgang, dass sich chinesische Spieler vor dem Alter von 28 Jahren vom Badmintonsport zurückzogen, um den Weg für die nächste Generation frei zu geben. Deswegen gibt es auch wenige Videos auf denen Yan als Spieler zu sehen ist. Eines der wenigen Videos zeigt Yan gegen die indonesische Badmintonlegende Lim Swie King 1980 in Singapur bei einem Ländermatch Indonesien vs. China.</p><p><strong>Größte Erfolge als Trainer</strong><br>Doch auch als Trainer war er in China sehr erfolgreich. Als Jugendnationaltrainer ebnete Yan Yujiang den Weg zu folgenden Erfolgen seiner SpielerInnen:</p><p>> Zhao Jianhua – BWF-Weltmeister –  1991<br>> Dong Jiong – Weltranglisten Erster – Vize Olympiasieger Atlanta, 1996<br>> Yang Yang –  2-facher BWF-Weltmeister – 1987 und 1989<br>> Pan Li – Asienmeisterin Damendoppel – 1992; aktuelle chinesische Nationaltrainerin für Damendoppel</p><p>Wir haben einige seiner langjährigen Weggefährten und erfolgreichsten SportlerInnen Fragen über Yan Yujiang gestellt. Als nächstes kommen die Olympiateilnehmer Michael Lahnsteiner und Simone Prutsch und die mehrfache Staatsmeisterin Claudia Mayer zu Wort.</p><p><strong>Michael Lahnsteiner</strong></p><p><strong>In welcher Zeit hast du mit Yan Yujiang trainiert?</strong><br><em>Ich habe 12 Jahre lang mit Yan trainiert, beginnend mit 14 Jahren, als ich nach Linz in das BORG für Leistungssportler gekommen bin.</em></p><p><strong>Welchen Einfluss hatte Yan für die Entwicklung deiner Badmintonkarriere?</strong><br><em>Yan hatte einen sehr großen Einfluss auf meine sportliche Karriere. Durch ihn lernte ich kennen, was notwendig ist um den Badmintonsport als Profi zu betreiben und gemeinsam trainierten wir hart und diszipliniert für dieses Ziel. So sehr Yan am Feld meinen großen Respekt und meine volle Anerkennung hat, so ist er für mich abseits des Courts immer noch ein sehr guter Freund. </em></p><p><strong>Simone Prutsch</strong></p><p><strong>Wieviele Jahre hast du mit Yan trainiert?</strong><br><em>Ich habe mit Yan 8 Jahre lang trainiert.</em></p><p><strong>Wie hast du vom Training mit Yan profitieren können?</strong><br><em>Die Grundtechnik und die Verfeinerung fast aller Schläge hat mit ihm stattgefunden. Ich habe gelernt immer 100% zu geben und dass Badminton ein Beruf sein kann.</em></p><p><strong>Wie beurteilst du seine menschlichen Fähigkeiten?</strong><br><em>Ehrlich und einfühlsam.</em></p><p><strong>Claudia Mayer</strong></p><p><strong>Wie hast du dich mit Yan auf die Olympia-Qualifikation vorbereitet?</strong><br><em>Die Vorbereitung hat eigentlich schon 2-3 Jahre vorher begonnen. Wir haben ein Trainingsniveau aufgebaut, dass notwendig war um international bestehen zu können und auch die vielen Turniere in der Qualifikationsphase selbst zu verkraften.

Ich habe in relativ kurzer Zeit extrem viel gelernt. Er hatte auf alles eine Antwort und er hat mir sehr viel beigebracht! Das Training war immer optimal auf mich abgestimmt. Es war manchmal hart und hat mich an meine Grenzen gebracht (was notwendig war um besser zu werden) aber oft war es auch lockerer mit Technik und Taktik. Er konnte sich perfekt auf einen Spieler einstellen. Ohne ihn wäre ich nie so weit gekommen und ich schätze ihn nicht nur als Trainer, sondern auch als Mensch!</em></p><p><strong>Fortsetzung folgt:<br> Im 3.

In der abgelaufenen Saison konnten sich sowohl Vorchdorf als auch Alkoven erst in der letzten Runde den Verbleib in der zweiten Bundesliga sichern. Auch heuer wird es wohl schwierig für die beiden Teams werden sich in der Bundesliga zu halten. Auch die Ohlsdorfer werden ohne Verstärkung in der neuen Saison zu kämpfen haben. Die Liga scheint kräftemäßig zweigeteilt zu sein. In der oberen Hälfte dürften sich der BSC 70 Linz, ASV Pressbaum und Badminton Moving Wiener Neustadt um die beiden Aufstiegsplätze streiten.

Auch in die Jubiläumssaison geht das UBC Team beinah unverändert.<br>Seit nunmehr 25 Jahren schlagen die Vorchdorfer Badmintonasse in der Badminton Bundesliga auf. Und der Stamm der Mannschaft ist auch in der kommenden Saison gleichgeblieben. Einzig mit Martina Nöst kam eine junge Einzelspielerin dazu. Nach dem Kreuzbandriss von Miriam Gruber musste das Vorchdorfer Team reagieren. Der  21-jährigen Gleisdorferin gelang bei den letzten Staatsmeisterschaften mit dem 3. Platz ihr Karrierehöhepunkt. Neben Nöst stehen noch Miriam Gruber, Zita Banhegyi und Tina Riedl im UBC-Damenkader.<br>Bei den Herren blieb alles unverändert: Primoz Flis, Erik Seiwald, Dominik Kronsteiner, Florian Brandstötter, Manuel Weber und Peter Moritz sind schon seit Jahren ein eingespieltes Team.<br>Das erste Saisonspiel findet am Samstag, 30. September 2017 (15 Uhr Sporthalle Vorchdorf) gegen den Absteiger BSC 70 Linz statt. Neben den Linzern gehören noch die beiden NÖ-Vereine Pressbaum und Wiener Neustadt zu den Favoriten – alle drei Teams setzen in erster Linie auf Legionäre. „<em>Das ist nicht unsere Linie!</em>“, sieht UBC Obmann Harald Starl keinen Sinn im Wettrüsten mit Legionären.</p><p><strong>BSC 70 Linz</strong><br><em>Ziele/Erwartungen für die neue Saison</em><br>Der Askö BSC 70 Linz scheidet nach 40 Jahren ununterbrochener Bundesligazugehörigkeit zur 1. Bundesliga/Staatsliga (1972-1977 Staatsliga B; seit 1977 in Staatsliga A/1. Bundesliga) mit Ende der Saison 2016/2017 freiwillig aus der 1. Bundesliga aus. Bisher spielt man 45 Jahre in der Badminton Bundesliga. Daraus ergibt sich für die Vereinsverantwortlichen eine komplett neue Situation. In der kommenden Saison heißt das Ziel weiterhin zu den 3 besten Mannschaften der Liga zu gehören und bei optimalem Verlauf auch auf einen Play-off Platz zu kommen. Die Ziele des Vereins stehen aber abseits der Bundesliga in der Entwicklung des Badmintonsports bzw. der Nachwuchsbetreuung.<br><em>Zugänge/Abgänge:</em><br>Sonja Langthaler und Wolfgang Gnedt sind weiterhin BSC 70 Linz Stammspieler – der Verein wird ihre Entwicklung weiterhin stark unterstützen. Sonja Langthaler wird auch für den BSC 70 Linz in der 2. Bundesliga antreten.<br>Wolfgang Gnedt wird für seine weitere sportliche Entwicklung gemeinsam mit Askö Traun (als Leihspieler) in der 1. Bundesliga vorantreiben. Nicht mehr im Kader des BSC 70 Linz ist das slowenische Talent – Miha Ivanic – und die langjährige Spielerin Nika Koncut.<br>Darüber hinaus sind alle langjährigen Spieler des Vereins weiterhin an Board.<br>Statement des Obmanns des BSC 70 Linz Reinhard Hechenberger:<br>„<em>Badminton Bundesliga und der BSC 70 Linz haben eine 45 jährige Tradition. Mit einer 40 jährigen ununterbrochen Zugehörigkeit zur 1. Badminton Liga blicken wir auf eine stolze Bilanz zurück, die es bei keinem anderem Verein ist Österreich gibt. Der freiwillige Ausstieg aus der 1. Liga ist aber für die Vereinsverantwortlichen kein Problem. Die 2. Liga wird hoffentlich auch dazu verhelfen die veränderte Ausrichtung, aber auch die Rahmenbedingungen im Sport besser bewältigen zu können. Der Fokus in der Vereinsarbeit besteht weiterhin an der Entwicklung des Badmintonsport und Nachwuchsbetreuung in Linz.</em>“</p><p>Das zweite Derby findet in der ersten Runde in Laakirchen statt. Am 30. September 2017 um 15:00 spielen die Union Ohlsdorf und BC Raiffeisen Alkoven gegeneinander.<br>Nachfolgend die Statements der beiden Vereine: </p><p><strong>BC Raiffeisen Alkoven</strong><br>Der BC Raiffeisen Alkoven ist für den Start in die neue Saison gerüstet. Da die Teamleaderin Iris Freimüller in Kürze ein Baby erwartet, mussten wir für sie einen Ersatz finden. Mit Isolde Pertl und Eva Rebhandl bekommen zwei junge Spielerinnen die Chance Bundesligaerfahrung zu sammeln. Bei den Herren sind die beiden Wiener Leihgaben Marian Gratzer und Andreas Laux neu im Kader, sie versuchen die entstandene Lücke die Harald Hochgatterer hinterlässt zu füllen. Damit hoffen wir auch heuer wieder mithalten zu können.<br>Favoriten für das Mittlere Play-Off sind der Papierform nach Pressbaum, BSC 70 Linz und Badminton Wr. Neustadt. den Rest werden sich wahrscheinlich die 3 OÖ-Vereine ausmachen. Natürlich hoffen wir im ersten Spiel auswärts gegen Ohlsdorf auf einen erfolgreichen Start. Ein spannendes und ausgeglichenes Spiel ist zu erwarten.</p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-09-26","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-zweite-Bundesliga-ndash-Saison-201718/5ba2986a9cff7.png","4");

Im ersten Derby beim BC Raiffeisen Alkoven konnten die Linzer mit einem 5:3 einen Sieg einfahren. Auswärts in Ohlsdorf setzte es aber am Sonntag ein 3:5 Niederlage. Bereits am Samstag spielte Union Ohlsdorf auswärts gegen den jetzt neuen Tabellenführer ASV Pressbaum. Dort gab es klare Verhältnisse. Die Pressbaumer setzten sich mit 7:1 durch. Somit rangieren Union Ohlsdorf und BSC 70 Linz mit jeweils 4 Punkten auf Tabellenplatz 4 bzw. 2.<br>Weniger Erfolgreich verlief das Wochenende für den BC Raiffeisen Alkoven.

Am Samstag gab es auswärts gegen Wiener Neustadt eine knappe 3:5 Niederlage und auch am Sonntag konnte gegen Pressbaum nichts ausgerichtet werden – 2:6. Damit stehen die beiden Mannschaften am Ende der Tabelle.<br><strong><br> Hier gibt es die Stimmen zur Doppelrunde: </strong></p><p><strong>BC Raiffeisen Alkoven (Fritz Freimüller): </strong><br>In den beiden Spielen der Doppelrunde am Wochenende war bei den Alkovener Badmintonspieler/innen eine deutliche Leistungssteigerung erkennbar. Zu einem vollen Erfolg hat es aber leider wieder nicht gereicht. Beim Heimspiel am Samstag gegen den BSC 70 Linz hätte das Alkovener Team zumindest einen Punkt verdient, am Ende setzte es aber eine knappe 3:5 Niederlage. Die Punkte holten Isolde Pertl/Maria Steinmann im Damendoppel, Thomas Hahn und Simon Rebhandl siegten in ihren Einzelspielen.<br>Am Sonntag mussten die Alkovener auswärts gegen das hoch favorisierte Team des BC Wr. Neustadt antreten. Mit dem Teamneuling Andreas Laux kam aber ein neuer Schwung in die Mannschaft. Ganz überraschend erkämpften die beiden Herrendoppel Simon Rebhandl/Andreas Laux und Thomas Hahn/Lukas Rebhandl durch ihre Siege eine 2:0 Führung. In den folgenden Spielen setzten sich dann aber die heimischen Spieler/innen zum Teil sehr knapp durch und gingen damit ihrerseits mit 4:2 in Führung. Dann aber erkämpften Thomas Hahn und das Mixed Simon Rebhandl/Isolde Pertl durch ihre gewonnenen Matches ein verdientes 4:4 Unentschieden.<br>Obmann Fritz Freimüller resümiert: <em>„Obwohl die vollen Erfolge ausblieben, bin ich mit der Leistung meiner Spieler/innen sehr zufrieden. Es gab sehr spannende Spiele und mit etwas Glück wäre in beiden Partien mehr drinnen gewesen.“</em></p><p><strong>Union Ohlsdorf (Josef Retschitzegger):</strong><br>Gegen Pressbaum am Samstag war, wie erwartet, nicht viel zu holen. Mit Vatanirappel und Pratama waren die Niederösterreicher für uns unüberwindbar. Obwohl die Niederlage nicht so hoch ausfallen hätte müssen.<br>Gegen Linz zeigte sich unsere Mannschaft von einer ganz andren Seite. Die etwa 70 Zuschauer in der Halle sorgten für eine großartige Stimmung und wurden durch hochklassige und spannende Spiele und letztendlich mit einem Ohlsdorfer Sieg belohnt. Obwohl die beiden Herrendoppel zu Beginn verloren gingen, sah man schon, dass heute viel möglich war. Der Einzelsieg von Florian Baumgartner hat alle zusätzlich beflügelt. Trotz hohem Einsatz wurden die sehr knappen Spiele äußerst fair geführt – ein Lob dafür auch an die LInzer Spieler. In der nun etwas längeren Bundesligapause heißt es aber weiterarbeiten, es ist immer noch vieles verbesserungswürdig.<br><strong><br> UBC Vorchdorf (Harald Starl):</strong><br>Zum Auftakt der „Ostrunde“ traf Vorchdorf ohne den erkrankten Manuel Weber  auf Wiener Neustadt, die in Bestbesetzung antraten. Während bei den Herren lediglich Primoz Flis / Florian Brandstötter einen Satzgewinn erzielen konnten, siegten Martina Nöst / Tina Riedl klar in 2 : 0 Sätzen. Eng ging es hingegen bei den Einzelpartien her: Erik Seiwald und Florian Brandstötter verloren jeweils mit 1 : 2 Sätzen. Martina Nöst konnte hingegen die Slowenin  Polc mit 17:21, 21:14, 22:20 besiegen und feierte damit ihren ersten Sieg im UBC-Dress. Den Endstand zum 3 : 5 fixierten Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi mit ihrem Sieg im Mixed. „Leider konnten wir die engen Partien nicht für uns entscheiden,“ ärgerte sich UBC Obmann Harald Starl über drei Dreisatzniederlagen.<br>Die sonntägige Partie führte UBC Vorchdorf zum Titelaspirant Pressbaum. Trotz der klaren Favoritenrolle zeigte das Wienerwaldteam Respekt und trat in Bestbesetzung gegen das UBC-Team an. Gegen  die starken Pressbaumer Herren hatten die Vorchdorfer wenig entgegen zu setzen und konnten lediglich in 5 Partien einen Satzgewinn durch Florian Brandstötter verbuchen. Stark wie immer die UBC-Ladies: Martina Nöst / Tina Riedl siegten im Damendoppel knapp in zwei Sätzen und auch Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi behielten im Mixed die „weiße Weste“ mit dem Dreisatzsieg über Vattanirappel / Meinke. Endstand: 6 : 2 für Pressbaum.  </p><p><em>„Mit der gezeigten Leistung in den beiden schweren Auswärtsspielen können wir grundsätzlich zufrieden sein,“</em> sah Harald Starl trotz der beiden Niederlagen auch viel Positives. <em>„Körperlich müssen wir aber noch etwas zulegen.“</em> Erfreut zeigte man sich im UBC Lager auch mit dem Heilungsprozess von Miriam Gruber nach ihrem Kreuzbandriss. An beiden Tagen spielte sich die ehemalige Topspielerin schon warm – Dank der starken UBC-Damenriege kann sie in Ruhe ihr Comeback vorbereiten.</p><p>Die Badminton Bundesliga wird erst Anfang Dezember mit dem Derby UBC Vorchdorf : UNION Ohlsdorf (Samstag, 2. Dezember 2017, 15 Uhr) fortgesetzt. <em>„Vielleicht gelingt uns ausgerechnet gegen Lokalrivale Ohlsdorf der Befreiungsschlag.“</em>, fiebert Starl dem Derby entgegen.<br><strong><br> [Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-10-24","/content/news/2-Bundesliga-ndash-knappe-Spiele-der-OOE-Teams/5ba29b3876e15.png","4");

Vielleicht gelingt es, die Tabellenspitze auch nach den beiden Begegnungen zu behaupten? Bei dieser Gelegenheit können wir unsere beiden neuen Verstärkungen Wolfgang Gnedt und Lisa Heidenreich dem Publikum vorstellen.<br>Die 26-jährige Deutsche Lisa Heidenreich zählte noch vor einiger Zeit zu den großen Hoffnungen im Nachbarland. Sie hat ihre internationale Karriere zwar beendet, ist aber unserem Sport als Trainerin und Spielerin immer treu geblieben. Mit der Aufgabe als Top- Dame  hat sie wieder neue Motivation geschöpft und trainiert seitdem wieder ernsthaft.<br>Die 20- jährige Leihgabe von BSC 70 Linz, Wolfgang Gnedt, war bereits vor einigen Jahren für unseren Verein in der Bundesliga im Einsatz. Der gebürtige Niederösterreicher zählt zu den hoffnungsvollsten Badmintonspielern in unserem Land. Sein großes Ziel ist die Teilnahme bei den nächsten Olympischen Spielen. </p><p>Einschätzung  von Team- Kapitän Jürgen Koch vor den beiden Spielen:<br><em>„Wir gehen heuer mit einer durchschnittlich sehr jungen Mannschaft in die Meisterschaft bzw. in die  ersten Heimspiele. In den nächsten Tagen werden wir uns noch sehr intensiv auf die Doppelrunde vorbereiten. Die Mödlinger sind sicher ein ernster Konkurrent für einen Play-off Platz. In der zweiten Begegnung am Sonntag  gegen den ambitionierten Vorarlberger Aufsteiger, aus Feldkirch, werden wir ebenso eine Topleistung benötigen.<br> Der Heimvorteil könnte bei gewohnt guter Unterstützung durch das Publikum ein kleiner Vorteil für uns sein“</em></p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-10-20","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-Doppelrunde-1-Bundesliga/5ba29c1799c2a.png","4");

Beide Teams wollen natürlich sofort den Wiederaufstieg und haben dementsprechende Spieler in ihren Reihen. Florian Baumgartner möchte mit seiner jungen Mannschaft aber mit einer klugen Doppelaufstellung Punkte holen. Am Samstag um 15:00 in der Sporthalle Laakirchen gegen Pressbaum und am Sonntag, beim Vormittagsspiel gegen Linz hoffen wir vor allem auf unser stimmkräftiges Publikum. Viel wird natürlich auch von der Tagesverfassung abhängen, aber wir glauben doch, Punkte entführen zu können.<br><strong><br> BSC 70 Linz (Reinhard Hechenberger)</strong><br>BSC 70 Linz wohl als Favorit gegen Alkoven zu sehen<br>Aufgrund des breiten Kaders sollte der BSC 70 Linz als Favorit in das Spiel gegen Alkoven gehen. Dennoch wird man konzentriert an die Spiele herangehen. Alkoven wird sicher alles versuchen um Punkte einfahren zu können.<br>Offener Schlagabtausch gegen Tabellenführer Ohlsdorf<br>Gegen Tabellenführer Ohlsdorf erwarten wir ein äußerst enges Spiel am Sonntag. Viel wird natürlich wieder von den Doppelspielen abhängen. Ein kleiner Vorteil könnte für Linz sein, dass Ohlsdorf tags zuvor gegen Pressbaum ein sehr hartes Auswärtsspiel hat. Schlussendlich zählt aber nur die Tagesform.<br><em>„An diesem Wochenende wird man ein verändertes Team des BSC 70 Linz sehen. Zudem wird Miha Horvat die Mannschaft als Mannschaftsführer in der Doppelrunde betreuen. Ziel ist es mit 3 Punkten aus dem Wochenende zu gehen.“</em></p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-10-20","/content/news/Vorberichterstattung-Doppelrunde-2-Bundesliga/5ba29c41a06b7.png","3");

Auch Lukas Rebhandl spielte im 1.Einzel über lange Strecken sehr gut, verpatzte den Erfolg aber mit einigen leichten Eigenfehlern. Erfreulich verlief das Debüt des jungen Eigenbauspielers Lukas Mittermayr, er gewann an der Seite von Lukas Rebhandl sein Doppel. Den zweiten Punkt steuerte Simon Rebhandl mit einem klaren Sieg im 2.Einzel bei. Nach dem Ausfall zweier Mannschaftsstützen gehen die Alkovener aber schwierigen Zeiten entgegen. Teamleaderin Iris Freimüller brachte vergangene Woche ein Mädchen zur Welt und fällt daher für längere Zeit aus. Christoph Lessl beendete aus familiären Gründen seine langjährige Karriere.</em></p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2017-10-02","/content/news/Bericht-2-Bundesliga/5ba29ded00aab.png","5");

In diesem  3-Satz-Match wurde den Zuschauern schon sehr sehenswertes Badminton geboten.

Die Revanche für die vorjährige Auswärtsniederlage ist vorerst geglückt. Die Stimmung in der Halle war teilweise so laut, dass man das eigene Wort nicht verstand. Das sehr fachkundige und  faire Heim-Publikum trieb ihre Vorarlberger Mannschaft zu Höchstleistungen, unsere Mannschaft  konnte aber äußerst erfolgreich dagegen halten.<br> In einer Woche rechnen wir beim Heimspiel mit einer ähnliche Unterstützung, sodass das Heimrecht beim 2. und wenn erforderlich beim 3. Spiel, ein kleiner Vorteil für uns sein kann. Die O.Ö. Badmintonfans werden sich dieses Spitzenereignis nicht entgehen lassen. Schließlich wird eine Trauner bzw. eine O.Ö. Mannschaft nicht so schnell Staatsmeister. Die gesamte Mannschaft freut sich auf das Badmintonereignis des Jahres</em>“</p><p>Die Detailergebnisse können auf der <a href=\"http://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=8B5B8973-84CA-40D2-9450-1277233E3172&draw=6\"><em><strong>Tournamentsoftware</strong></em></a> nachgelesen werden. </p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2018-04-30","/content/news/Start-in-die-Best-off-3-Serie-mit-Sieg-im-Auswaertsspiel/5ba2a99f627eb.png","8");

UBC Vorchdorf muss nach 25 Jahren Bundesliga erstmals absteigen – die Vorchdorfer verloren das Relegationsspiel gegen VRC Badminton Vienna knapp mit 3:5. Vorchdorf konnte in Bestbesetzung gegen die Wiener Legionärstruppe antreten und von Anfang an war klar, dass vor allem die vier kroatischen Spieler in den Reihen der Wiener der „Knackpunkt“ sein werden.</strong></p><p>Ausgeglichen gestaltete sich der Start – nach den beiden Herrendoppel stand es 1 : 1, wobei Dominik Kronsteiner / Erik Seiwald für Vorchdorf punkteten. Die ansonsten erfolgsverwöhnten Vorchdorfer Damen konnten den beiden kroatischen Ex-Teamspielerinnen nichts entgegen setzen und verloren klar.UBC Youngster Zalar überragendDas Topeinzel zwischen Tilen Zalra und Igor Cimbur war wohl eines der besten Topeinzelpartien der letzten Jahre – in einem Marathonspiel konnte sich der 20-jährige UBC-Neuling Zalar mit 21:16, 18:21, 21:18 duchsetzen und abermals ausgleichen. Primoz Flis kämpfte aufopfernd, musste sich aber in drei Sätzen knapp geschlagen geben. Den „Todesstoss“ setzte die Niederlage von Martina Nöst gegen Drvodelic. Zwar konnte Erik Seiwald noch einmal mit einem 2 : 0 Satzsieg verkürzen, ehe die Mixedniederlage von Dominik Kronsteiner / Zita Banhegyi den 3 : 5 Endstand bedeutete. Damit muss UBC Vorchdorf nach 25 Jahren Bundesliga Zugehörigkeit in die OÖ. Landesliga absteigen.</p><p><strong>Kommentar von UBC Vorchdorf Manager Harald Starl: </strong><br>Beste Saisonleistung war zu wenig. Besonders ärgerlich ist aus Vorchdorfer Sicht die Tatsache, dass ausgerechnet die beste Saisonleistung zum Abstieg führte. Speziell bei den Damen waren die Wiener überragend. „<em>Das war der Schlüssel,</em>“ schmerzt UBC Obmann Harald Starl die Niederlage besonders. „<em>Mit dieser „Retorten-Truppe“ werden die Wiener sicher ganz vorne mitspielen.</em>“ Quo vadis UBC? UBC Vorchdorf wird in der kommenden Saison in der 1. OÖ. Landesliga antreten. Dazu muss sich der Verein nun neu aufstellen, da die Bundesligamannschaft auf keinen Fall gehalten werden kann. „<em>Wir haben nun einige Monate Zeit, eine konkurrenzfähige Mannschaft aufzustellen und dann werden wir sehen, ob ein Wiederaufstieg angestrebt wird,</em>“ so Harald Starl, der 25 Jahre lang die Bundesliga Aktivitäten der Vorchdorfer managte.</p><p>Die Ergebnisse gibt es auf <a href=\"https://obv.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/teammatch.aspx?id=8B5B8973-84CA-40D2-9450-1277233E3172&match=110\"><em><strong>Tournamentsoftware</strong></em></a> zum Nachlesen.</p><p><strong>[Bericht: Redaktion – Lukas Rebhandl]</strong></p>","2018-05-14","/content/news/UBC-Vorchdorf-sagt-nach-25-Jahren-ade-ndash-Relegation-knapp-verloren/5ba3e3a93bc60.png","5");

Wie in den Partien zuvor konnte sich das erste Herrendoppel Jürgen Koch / Peter Zauner durchsetzen. Danach ging überraschend auch das Damendoppel die Traunerinnen (22:20 im dritten Satz).

Weiters diente der Kurs auch als Überprüfung des OÖBV-Nachwuchskaders-Status.<br>Als Trainingspartner standen Wolfgang Gnedt, Filimon Collins und Alexander Serov zur Verfügung. In einigen gemeinsamen Einheiten wurde versucht junge und ältere Spieler miteinander trainieren zu lassen, um voneinander zu profitieren zu können. Die Stimmung war den gesamten Kurs über sehr positiv. Der dadurch entstandene Teamgeist lässt auf eine erfolgreiche Saison hoffen. Der OÖBV wird versuchen den Schwung dieses Kurses mitzunehmen und mehrere Kurse dieser Art über die gesamte Saison einzubauen und dadurch ein größere Anzahl und bessere Nachwuchsspieler zu entwickeln. </p><p><strong>[Bericht: Peter Zauner]</strong></p>","2018-09-15","/content/news/OOEBV-Nachwuchs-Sommerkurs/5ba3e7d6da0be.png","12");

Gestartet wurde mit einem sehr ausführlichen 20-Minütigen Aufwärmen. Danach spielten wir uns 20 Minuten ein worauf hin wir mit 30 Minuten Drive fortfuhren. Darauf 2 mal 25 Minuten Drive Angriff und Verteidigung.</strong></p><p>Glücklicher weise hatten wir am Nachmittag Zeit zum Regenerieren für den morgigen Tag.</p><p>Freitag:<br>Aufgestanden um 6:45 mit anschließendem Frühstück begann das Training um 8:15 Uhr</p><p>Angefangen mit täglichem Aufwärmen begannen wir das Frühtraining mit 50 Minuten Kraftkammer worauf hin wir 70 Minuten Drive (neutral, defensiv, offensiv) und danach ein 10-Minütiges Dehnprogramm absolvierten.</p><p>Danach gab es ein gemeinsames Mittagsessen. Um 15 :00 Uhr startete das Training wie immer mit dem Aufwärmen. Dann spielten wir ca. 1 Stunde Matches wobei sich 2 Runden ausgingen. Dann kam eine sehr fordernde Ballmaschine zuerst Smash, Netz und Töten danach stand der Trainer auf einer Bank um uns für die Verteidigung auf zu spielen. Danach wieder 10 Minuten Dehnen.</p><p>Am Abend war wieder Regeneration.</p><p>Samstag:<br>Trainingsstart wie gewohnt mit Aufwärmen woraufhin wir 110 Minuten Matches also 3 Runden spielten. Anschließend 10-Minütiges Dehnen. Nachmittagstraining startete wieder mit dem gewohnten ausführlichen Aufwärmen 10 Runden auf einer Strecke von 400m mit 70% Intensität. Danach 10 Minuten Dehnen.</p><p>Sonntag:<br>Genügend Zeit zum Shoppen Massieren etc. was die meisten Spieler ausgenützt haben.</p><p>Das Training hier ist wirklich sehr hart und anstrengend. Am Anfang der Woche ist es schwer vorstellbar wie man die Woche überstehen soll. Wenn man sich aber Tag für Tag neu motiviert merkt man jedoch, wie man sich langsam an die Belastungen gewöhnt und immer besser mit den Chinesen mithalten kann. Vor allem die Kraft und das Ballgefühl werden im Laufe der Zeit immer besser. Ich hoffe, die letzten Tage noch gut zu überstehen und den Schwung in die neue Saison mitnehmen zu können.

Auch im zweiten Satz schien es, dass er gut dagegenhalten kann, doch nach 11:10 Rückstand fehlte die nötige Kraft um das hohe erforderliche Tempo mitzuhalten. Er verlor den Satz auf 13. Nach äußerst kurzer Pause (25 Minuten) bestritt er dann das Herrendoppel mit Partner Lenny Sudarma (Mödling) gegen zwei Ungar. Die beiden konnten leider nur selten ihre Taktik umsetzen und verloren leider knapp auf 21:17 16:21 21:18.</p><p><strong>Fazit Luca:</strong> „<em>Ich bin mit meiner Leistung sehr zufrieden. Ich konnte in meinem ersten Match meinen Spielplan ohne viele Fehler gut durchziehen, ebenso im zweiten Einzel gelang mir dies. Gegen den Jugendweltranglisten 37 konnte ich wirklich gut mithalten und hatte auch, vor allem im ersten Satz, die Chance einen Satz zu gewinnen. Aber trotzdem bin ich mit dem Match äußert zufrieden. Im Doppel fiel es mir schwer mich zu konzentrieren und deshalb machte ich einige leichte Fehler, die zu vermeiden waren. Im Großen und Ganzen bin ich aber glücklich mit meinen Leistungen.</em>“</p><p><strong>[Bericht: Peter Zauner]</strong></p>","2018-11-03","/content/news/TEM-Slovenia-Junior-International/5be09b3add346.png","12");

Aufgrund der seit heuer geltender neuer Regelung schlug sich der Sieg mit 4 Punkten in der Tabelle, und damit mit der vorläufigen Tabellenführung, nieder.</p><p>„Wir haben aus Deutschland eine neue Regelung übernommen. Aufgrund dieser Bestimmungen gibt es seit heuer bei einem 8:0 oder 7:1 Sieg 4 Punkte, bei einem 6:2 oder 5:3 Erfolg aber nur 3 Punkte. Die Spitzenmannschaften können es sich fast nicht wirklich leisten, verschiedentlich dem bereitstehenden Nachwuchs eine Chance in der Bundesliga-Mannschaft zu geben. Die Änderungen sollen anderseits bei einer 5 Punkte-Führung die Spannung in einer Begegnung bis zum Schluss aufrechterhalten. Beide Überlegungen haben etwas auf sich. Eine Diskussion darüber vor der nächsten Saison ist sinnvoll.</p><p>Um für die Finalphase eine optimale Ausgangsbasis zu schaffen, die besser platzierte Mannschaft nach dem Grunddurchgang hat im Semifinale das Heimrecht, müssen die Clubs dieses Ziel immer mit berücksichtigen. Ein Experiment bei der Zusammenstellung der Mannschaft ist damit fast nicht möglich. Die Entwicklungsmöglichkeit der Talente wird dadurch möglicherweise eingeschränkt. Diesen Umstand haben wir bei der Bundesliga-Reform möglicherweise zu wenig berücksichtigt.</p><p>Natürlich sind wir mit der Leistung der gesamten Mannschaft sehr zufrieden. Ein Aufwärtstrend aller unserer Teammitglieder ist klar ersichtlich. Das Projekt „Titelverteidigung“ ist aufgrund der starken Gegenwehr unserer Konkurrenz nicht leicht, aber ein großes, mögliches Saisonziel. Am 1.

Als Einzelspiel (zwei Spieler) oder als Doppel (zwei Spielpaare), wird von den Spielern ein gefiederter Ball im Flug mit einem Schl&auml;ger abwechselnd hin- und hergeschlagen. Ziel eines solchen Ballwechsels ist es, den Federball den Regeln entsprechend so &uuml;ber das Netz zu spielen, dass er in der Spielh&auml;lfte des Gegners den Boden ber&uuml;hrt oder von ihm nur fehlerhaft zur&uuml;ckgespielt werden kann.</p><p>Badminton erh&auml;lt seinen Reiz durch das besondere Flugverhalten des Balles. Er wird bis auf 300 km/h beschleunigt, kann aber im n&auml;chsten Augenblick leicht wie eine Feder zu Boden sinken.

m (an den Pfosten) bzw. 1,524 m (Feldmitte) vom Boden entfernt.</p><h4>Federball</h4><p>Der Federball darf aus nat&uuml;rlichen und/oder synthetischen Materialien hergestellt werden. Geschwindigkeitstest von Federb&auml;llen: Kr&auml;ftiger Unterhandschlag (nicht maximal) von der r&uuml;ckw&auml;rtigen Begrenzungslinie (= hintere Aufschlaglinie f&uuml;r Einzel. Der Federball sollte auf der anderen Seite ungef&auml;hr auf die hintere Aufschlaglinie f&uuml;r Doppel fallen. M&ouml;gliche Abweichung: ca. + 27 cm/- 15 cm.</p><p>In manchen Feldern sind Markierungen angebracht die den Bereich angeben, in den ein Ball bei einem Geschwindigkeitstest fliegen soll. Danach landet ein Federball mit korrekter Geschwindigkeit nicht weniger als 53 cm und nicht mehr als 99 cm von der r&uuml;ckw&auml;rtigen Begrenzungslinie entfernt auf dem Boden. Die Geschwindigkeit von Naturfederb&auml;llen kann ver&auml;ndert werden, indem man die Spitzen der Federn nach innen (= schneller) oder nach au&szlig;en (=langsamer) umknickt.</p><h4>Schl&auml;ger</h4><p>Folgende Ma&szlig;e d&uuml;rfen nicht &uuml;berschritten werden: Gesamtl&auml;nge: max. 68 cm, Gesamtbreite max. 23cm. Bespannte Fl&auml;che: L&auml;nge max. 28 cm, Breite max. 22 cm.</p><h4>Los</h4><p>Vor Spielbeginn wird gelost. Die Seite, die das Los gewinnt, darf w&auml;hlen zwischen erstem Aufschlag, R&uuml;ckschlag oder Spielbeginn auf einer bestimmten Seite. Wird erster Aufschlag gew&auml;hlt, darf der Verlierer des Loses die Seite w&auml;hlen. Wird R&uuml;ckschlag gew&auml;hlt, darf er aufschlagen und die Seite w&auml;hlen. W&auml;hlt der Losgewinner die Seite, darf der Verlierer zwischen erstem Aufschlag und R&uuml;ckschlag w&auml;hlen.</p><h4>Spiel- und Punktst&auml;nde</h4><p>Jede Partei kann unabh&auml;ngig vom Aufschlag punkten. Es werden zwei Gewinns&auml;tze bis 21 Punkte je Satz gespielt. Eine Partei hat einen Satz gewonnen, wenn sie als erste 21 Punkte erreicht und dabei mindestens 2 Punkte mehr als die gegnerische Partei hat. Bei 21:20 wird das Spiel solange verl&auml;ngert, bis eine Partei mit 2 Punkten f&uuml;hrt (bis maximal 30 Punkte). Ein Satzergebnis von 30:29 ist demnach m&ouml;glich. F&uuml;r jeden gewonnenen Ballwechsel wird ein Punkt vergeben. Zus&auml;tzlich erh&auml;lt die Partei, die den vorangegangenen Ballwechsel f&uuml;r sich entschieden hat, das Aufschlagsrecht.</p><h4>Wechsel der Spielfeldseiten</h4><p>Die Spieler wechseln die Seiten: nach Ende des 1. Satzes; vor Beginn des 3. Satzes; im dritten Satz bei 11.</p><h4>Aufschlagregeln</h4><p>Sobald die Spieler ihre Positionen eingenommen haben, gilt die erste Vorw&auml;rtsbewegung des Schl&auml;gerkopfes als Aufschlagbeginn. Der Aufschlag gilt als ausgef&uuml;hrt, wenn der Ball vom Schl&auml;ger des Aufschl&auml;gers getroffen wurde oder der Ball den Boden ber&uuml;hrt. Wenn der Aufschl&auml;ger den Ball nicht trifft und der Federball zu Boden geht oder vom Aufschl&auml;ger nach dem Anwerfen wieder gefangen wird; ist dies ein Fehler. Ein Fehler liegt auch vor, wenn sich beim Aufschlag der Federball an der Netzkante verf&auml;ngt und h&auml;ngenbleibt oder nach &Uuml;berfliegen des Netzes im Netz h&auml;ngenbleibt.</p><p>Ein Aufschlag darf nicht verz&ouml;gert werden (mehr als 5 Sek.). Ein Teil beider F&uuml;&szlig;e des Aufschl&auml;gers und R&uuml;ckschl&auml;gers muss w&auml;hrend des Aufschlags in ruhiger Boden-ber&uuml;hrung bleiben, d.h. ein Nachziehen eines Fu&szlig;es ist nicht erlaubt (keine ruhige Stellung), ein Wippen mit dem Fu&szlig; ist erlaubt, wenn es nicht als unfaire Handlung angesehen werden kann.</p><p>F&uuml;r Auf- u. R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger gilt: nicht die Linien ber&uuml;hren! Der Ball darf beim Aufschlag nur am Fu&szlig; (Kopf), also nicht an den Federn und auch nicht an Fu&szlig; und Federn gemeinsam getroffen werden; der Balltreffpunkt muss unter der Taille liegen. Die Taille wird als Linie in H&ouml;he des untersten Punktes der untersten Rippe (2 Finger breit &uuml;ber dem Beckenkamm) definiert; die Hand, die den Schl&auml;ger h&auml;lt, muss bei Aufschlagausf&uuml;hrung deutlich &uuml;ber dem oberen Rand des Schl&auml;gerkopfes sein; eine Bewegungsunterbrechung gilt als T&auml;uschung (gleichm&auml;&szlig;ige Beschleunigung).</p><p>Der Aufschl&auml;ger und der R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger stehen sich in ihren Feldern schr&auml;g gegen&uuml;ber (der Aufschlag erfolgt in das diagonal liegende Aufschlagfeld der gegnerischen Seite), beim Doppel d&uuml;rfen die Partner von Auf- u. R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger (auf ihrer Spielfeldseite) &uuml;berall stehen, sie d&uuml;rfen aber den Aufschl&auml;ger/R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger nicht in der Sicht behindern. Eine Wiederholung eines Aufschlages gibt es, wenn der Aufschl&auml;ger und der R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger bei der Aufschlagausf&uuml;hrung gleichzeitig einen Fehler machen (z.B. beide heben einen Fu&szlig;). Eine Wiederholung muss auch dann erfolgen, wenn der R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger nicht bereit war. Ein R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger war bereit, wenn er a) mit Blick auf den Aufschl&auml;ger ruhig stand und b) einen R&uuml;ckschlagversuch unternahm.</p><h4>Fehler</h4><p>Ein Fehler liegt von wenn:</p><ul><li>der Federball au&szlig;erhalb der Begrenzungslinien des Spielfeldes den Boden ber&uuml;hrt; er durch das Netz oder unter dem Netz hindurchfliegt; er das Netz nicht &uuml;berfliegt; er das Dach, die Decke oder die Seitenw&auml;nde ber&uuml;hrt; er einen Spieler oder seine Kleidung ber&uuml;hrt (auch wenn sich der Spieler au&szlig;erhalb des Spielfeldes befindet); er irgendeinen anderen Gegenstand oder eine andere Person au&szlig;erhalb der Spielfeldumgebung ber&uuml;hrt.</li><li>sich im Spiel der Anfangsber&uuml;hrungspunkt mit dem Federball nicht auf der Seite des Netzes des Schlagenden befindet. Der Schlagende darf aber im Verlauf eines Schlages mit seinem Schl&auml;ger dem Federball &uuml;ber das Netz folgen. Ein R&uuml;ckschlag darf schon erfolgen, wenn erst ein Teil des Federballes das Netz &uuml;berflogen hat.</li><li>ein Spieler, w&auml;hrend der Ball im Spiel ist das Netz oder dessen Haltevorrichtung mit dem Schl&auml;ger, seinem K&ouml;rper oder seiner Bekleidung ber&uuml;hrt; er mit dem Schl&auml;ger oder seinem K&ouml;rper &uuml;ber dem Netz in das gegnerische Spielfeld eindringt; er mit dem Schl&auml;ger oder seinem K&ouml;rper unter dem Netz in das gegnerische Spielfeld eindringt und der Gegner dadurch behindert oder gest&ouml;rt wird (erlaubt ist es jedoch, beim Versuch einen netznahen Ball zur&uuml;ckzuschlagen mit dem Fu&szlig; oder einem Teil des Schl&auml;gers in die gegnerische Seite einzudringen, nur darf der Gegner nicht behindert werden); er den Gegner daran hindert, einen zul&auml;ssigen Schlag auszuf&uuml;hren, der dem Federball &uuml;ber das Netz folgt (also nicht erlaubt: Schl&auml;ger einfach &uuml;ber die Netzkante halten, um einen Ball abprallen zu lassen); er w&auml;hrend des Spieles seinen Gegner vors&auml;tzlich durch irgendwelche Handlungen wie Rufen oder Geb&auml;rden ablenkt.</li><li>der im Spiel befindliche Ball vom Schl&auml;ger aufgefangen und festgehalten wird und dann geschleudert wird; der Ball vom selben Spieler zweimal hintereinander mit 2 Schl&auml;gen geschlagen wird; der Ball von einem Spieler und dessen Partner hintereinander geschlagen wird (im Doppel).</li></ul><h4>Wiederholung</h4><p>Eine Wiederholung kann bei jedem unvorhergesehenen oder unbeabsichtigten Ereignis gegeben werden, also wenn etwas zuf&auml;llig und ungewollt geschiet:</p><ul><li>Ber&uuml;hrung des Daches oder herabh&auml;ngender Teile durch den Ball</li><li>Ber&uuml;hrung eines &uuml;ber die Netzkante (&uuml;ber 1,55 Meter) hinausragenden Teiles des Netzpfostens durch den Ball sofern der Pfosten auf der seitlichen Begrenzungslinie f&uuml;r Doppel steht. Steht er au&szlig;erhalb: Fehler. Ist der Pfosten nicht h&ouml;her als das Netz: so entscheiden, als wenn die Netzkante ber&uuml;hrt worden w&auml;re.</li><li>Ein Gegenstand (z. B. Federball aus Nachbarfeld) f&auml;llt ins Spielfeld oder den Auslauf oder durchfliegt den Raum &uuml;ber dem Spielfeld. Wenn eine Person durch den Auslauf geht und einen Spieler irritiert oder beintr&auml;chtigt, gibt es auch Wiederholung.</li></ul><p>Eine Wiederholung kann gegeben werden, wenn der Ball der Sicht des Schiedsrichters oder eines Spielers zeitweilig entzogen wird.</p><p>Keine Wiederholung gibt es, wenn im Doppel eine Behinderung durch den Partner erfolgt.</p><p>Eine Wiederholung gibt es, wenn:</p><ul><li>der Federball sich derart im Netz verf&auml;ngt, dass er auf der Oberkante h&auml;ngenbleibt oder nach &Uuml;berfliegen des Netzes im Netz h&auml;ngenbleibt (bei einem Aufschlag gilt dies nicht),</li><li>w&auml;hrend des Aufschlages sowohl R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger wie auch Aufschl&auml;ger gleichzeitig einien Fehler begehen.</li><li>der Aufschl&auml;ger den Aufschlag ausf&uuml;hrt, bevor der R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ger bereit ist.</li><li>w&auml;hrend des Spieles der Federball auseinanderf&auml;llt und sich der Fu&szlig; vollst&auml;ndig vom &uuml;brigen Federball l&ouml;st. Keine Wiederholung gibt es aber wenn der Ball durch Zusammenziehen des Korbes zur &bdquo;Rakete&ldquo; wird.</li></ul><h4>Federball nicht im Spiel</h4><p>Ein Federball ist nicht mehr im Spiel, wenn:</p><ul><li>er das Netz ber&uuml;hrt und sich dort verf&auml;ngt oder an der Netzoberkante h&auml;ngenbleibt.</li><li>er das Netz oder den Pfosten ber&uuml;hrt und dann auf die Netzseite des den Schlag ausf&uuml;hrenden Spielers zur&uuml;ckf&auml;llt (also bei Beginn der Abw&auml;rtsbewegung ist der Federball nicht mehr im Spiel, d.h. ein Gegner, der nach Beginn der Abw&auml;rtsbewegung mit seinen Schl&auml;ger das Netz ber&uuml;hrt begeht keinen Fehler).</li><li>er den Boden des Spielfeldes ber&uuml;hrt.</li><li>der Tatbestand eines Fehlers oder einer Wiederholung vorliegt.</li></ul><p><strong>Quelle:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.badminton.at/\" target=\"_blank\">badminton.at</a></p>");
